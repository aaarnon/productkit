# OKR-Builder Utility

## Purpose

Formulates Objectives and Key Results with outcome-based goals when OKRs are appropriate.

---

## Invocation

**Agent-called:** Typically called by Metrics agent

---

## Knowledge Folder

**Primary folder:** `knowledge/metrics/`

Search for "OKR" in this folder for detailed guidance on OKR fundamentals and avoiding OKR theatre. New files added to this folder are automatically available.

---

## When to Use OKRs

**Good fit:**
- Series A+ with stable quarterly cadence
- Teams with clear strategic direction
- Organizations with outcome measurement capability

**May not fit:**
- Pre-seed/seed moving too fast for quarterly cycles
- Teams without clear strategy (fix strategy first)
- Early discovery phase (too much uncertainty)

---

## OKR Structure

### Objective
- **Qualitative** - What we want to achieve
- **Inspiring** - Motivates the team
- **Time-bound** - Typically quarterly
- **Ambitious** - Stretch goal (70% achievement is good)

### Key Results
- **Quantitative** - Measurable outcomes
- **Outcomes, not outputs** - What changed, not what we did
- **Leading indicators** - Predictive of business success
- **3-5 per objective** - Focused, not exhaustive

## Outcome vs Output Test

| Output (Bad) | Outcome (Good) |
|--------------|----------------|
| Launch feature X | Increase activation rate by 15% |
| Ship 10 features | Reduce churn from 5% to 3% |
| Complete project Y | Improve NPS from 40 to 50 |
| Run 5 experiments | Increase conversion by 20% |

## OKR Formulation Process

### Step 1: Start with Strategy
- What strategic priority does this support?
- What outcome would indicate strategic progress?

### Step 2: Draft Objective
Template: `[Verb] [what] [for whom/why]`

Examples:
- "Become the go-to solution for small business invoicing"
- "Establish product-market fit in enterprise segment"

### Step 3: Define Key Results
For each objective, ask:
- What would be different if we achieved this?
- How would we measure success?
- What leading indicators predict this outcome?

### Step 4: Validate
- Are KRs outcomes (not outputs)?
- Are KRs within team's influence?
- Are KRs ambitious but achievable?
- Do KRs ladder up to objective?

## Output Format

```
## Objective
[Qualitative, inspiring goal]

## Key Results
1. [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]
2. [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]
3. [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]

## Strategic Alignment
[How this connects to strategy]

## Leading vs Lagging
- KR1: [Leading/Lagging] - [Why]
- KR2: [Leading/Lagging] - [Why]
- KR3: [Leading/Lagging] - [Why]
```

## Escape OKR Theatre

Common pitfalls that turn OKRs into theatre:

1. **Output OKRs** - Measuring activities, not outcomes
2. **Too many OKRs** - Diluted focus
3. **Set and forget** - No regular check-ins
4. **Punishment for missing** - Discourages ambition
5. **Disconnected from strategy** - OKRs that don't matter
