# Strategy

Defines how to win in the market. Works through three interconnected patterns: why this opportunity (Narrative), where we compete (Playing Field), and how we position to win (Winning Moves).

---

## Quick Start

1. Check `context/vision.md` exists (if not, build foundation first)
2. Identify which pattern needs work: Narrative, Playing Field, or Winning Moves
3. Apply the "Does this help us say NO?" test
4. See `## Strategy` in `resources.md` for knowledge (Core first, Additional as needed)

---

## Co-Creation Flow (Default)

Build strategy element by element with the user. This is the default mode.

### Flow Overview

```
Section 1: Strategic Narrative (6 elements)
  → Vision → North Star → Market Reality → Hypothesis → Urgency → Conviction
  → [Confirm section before continuing]

Section 2: Playing Field (3 elements)
  → Audiences → Jobs → Alternatives
  → [Confirm section before continuing]

Section 3: Winning Moves (5 elements)
  → Segments → Value Props → Channels → Differentiators → Trade-offs
  → [Confirm section before continuing]

Section 4: Risks & Validation
  → [Assemble full strategy document]
```

### Working Through Each Element

For each element:
1. **Explain** - What this element is and why it matters (1-2 sentences)
2. **Ask** - One focused question to gather input
3. **Reflect** - Restate what you heard, ask if it's right
4. **Confirm** - Get explicit confirmation before moving to next element

### Section 1: Strategic Narrative

**Element 1: Vision (reference)**
- Explain: "Let's anchor the strategy in your vision. This connects where you're going to how you'll get there."
- Ask: "Looking at your vision, what's the key aspiration we're building strategy around?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 2: North Star**
- Explain: "North Star is the 1-3 metrics that define winning. If these move, you're succeeding."
- Ask: "What metric(s) would tell you the strategy is working? What does 'winning' look like in numbers?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 3: Market Reality**
- Explain: "Market Reality is what's happening in the market that creates your opportunity. Facts, not opinions."
- Ask: "What's happening in your market right now that creates an opening for you?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 4: Hypothesis**
- Explain: "Your hypothesis is what you believe that others don't. This is your contrarian bet."
- Ask: "What do you believe about this market or problem that most competitors don't see or disagree with?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 5: Urgency**
- Explain: "Urgency is why now. What window exists and why must you act in this timeframe?"
- Ask: "Why is now the right time? What happens if you wait 12 months?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 6: Conviction**
- Explain: "Conviction is why customers will choose you over alternatives. Your reason to win."
- Ask: "Why will customers choose you instead of the alternatives? What makes you the right choice?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Section Checkpoint:**
- Summarize Strategic Narrative (2-3 sentences)
- Show all 6 elements captured
- Ask: "Anything to adjust before we move to Playing Field?"

### Section 2: Playing Field

**Element 7: Audiences**
- Explain: "Audiences are who you're building for. Be specific about the people, not just companies."
- Ask: "Who specifically are you building for? What defines them?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 8: Jobs**
- Explain: "Jobs are the progress your audience is trying to make. What they're hiring your product to do."
- Ask: "What progress are these people trying to make? What job are they hiring you for?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 9: Alternatives**
- Explain: "Alternatives are what you're compared against. Not just competitors, but any way they solve this today."
- Ask: "What do people use today instead of you? Include doing nothing, spreadsheets, competitors, workarounds."
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Section Checkpoint:**
- Summarize Playing Field (2-3 sentences)
- Show all 3 elements captured
- Ask: "Anything to adjust before we move to Winning Moves?"

### Section 3: Winning Moves

**Element 10: Segments**
- Explain: "Segments are which customers get priority. You can't serve everyone equally."
- Ask: "Which customer segments are highest priority? Who do you focus on first?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 11: Value Props**
- Explain: "Value Props are the specific value you deliver to your priority segments."
- Ask: "What value do you deliver to these segments? What do they get from you?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 12: Channels**
- Explain: "Channels are how you reach your customers. How they discover and engage with you."
- Ask: "How do customers find you and how do you reach them?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 13: Differentiators**
- Explain: "Differentiators are what makes you hard to copy. Your sustainable advantage."
- Ask: "What makes you hard to copy? What advantage compounds over time?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Element 14: Trade-offs**
- Explain: "Trade-offs are what you're NOT doing. Strategy is as much about saying no as saying yes."
- Ask: "What are you explicitly NOT doing? What would be reasonable to do but you're choosing not to?"
- Reflect back, confirm before continuing

**Section Checkpoint:**
- Summarize Winning Moves (2-3 sentences)
- Show all 5 elements captured
- Ask: "Anything to adjust before we finalize the strategy?"

### Section 4: Risks & Assembly

After all elements confirmed:
1. Identify 3-4 key risks based on the strategy
2. Present risks and ask for mitigation ideas
3. Run the "Does this help us say NO?" validation
4. Assemble full strategy document
5. Run verification checks
6. Save to `context/strategy.md`

### Skip Option

If user says "just draft it" or "skip ahead":
- Respect the request
- Draft remaining elements based on available context
- Mark gaps with `[Needs input: ...]`

## Core Purpose

**Strategy answers:**
- How will we win?
- What choices will we make (and NOT make)?
- Where will we focus?
- What advantages will we build?

**Strategy is NOT:**
- Vision (see `vision` skill)
- Roadmap (see `roadmap` skill)
- Execution plan

---

## Quick Reference

```
STRATEGIC NARRATIVE  →  Why this market opportunity?
PLAYING FIELD        →  Where do we compete?
WINNING MOVES        →  How do we position to win?

TEST: Does this help us say NO?
```

See `knowledge/strategy/product-strategy-patterns-herbig.md` for detailed framework with connections.

---

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Strategic Choices** - Define where to play, how to win, what to prioritize
2. **Framework Application** - Apply DHM, Four Fits, and other strategic frameworks
3. **Strategy Validation** - Test if strategy is decisive, differentiated, feasible
4. **Trade-off Articulation** - Make explicit what we're NOT doing

---

## Output Format

**Primary artifact:** Strategy document structured by patterns

```
## Strategic Narrative (Why)
**Vision:** [Future state for users]
**North Star:** [1-3 metrics that define winning]

**Market Reality:** [What's happening in the market that creates opportunity?]
**Our Hypothesis:** [What do we believe that others don't?]
**Urgency:** [Why must we act now? What's the window?]
**Conviction:** [Why will customers choose us over alternatives?]

## Playing Field (Where)
**Audiences:** [Who we're building for]
**Jobs:** [Progress they care about]
**Alternatives:** [What we're compared against]

## Winning Moves (How)
**Segments:** [Which customers get priority]
**Value Props:** [What value we deliver]
**Channels:** [How we reach them]
**Differentiators:** [What makes us hard-to-copy]
**Trade-offs:** [What we're NOT doing]

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk Category | Example Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| [Category]    | [Specific risk] | [What happens if this occurs] | [How we'll address it] |

## Validation
Does this strategy help us say NO? [Yes/No + evidence]
```

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Decisive** - Strategy helps team say NO clearly
2. **Differentiated** - Strategy is distinct from alternatives
3. **Actionable** - Teams can derive decisions from it
4. **Aligned** - All three patterns reinforce each other
5. **Focused** - Clear choices, not a list of everything

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Indecisive strategy** - Trying to do everything, no clear focus
2. **Me-too strategy** - Copying competitors without differentiation
3. **Feature list strategy** - Confusing tactics with strategy
4. **Vague platitudes** - "Be customer-focused" without specifics
5. **Mismatched work type** - Growth work when need PMF work

---

## Verification Criteria

Before presenting strategy deliverable, run these checks. Maximum 3 regeneration attempts per failed check.

### Foundation Prerequisites

**Check before creating strategy:**
- [ ] **Vision exists** - context/vision.md must exist

**If missing:** Warn user and recommend building vision first. User can override and proceed with gaps.

### Structural Requirements

**Pattern Completeness:**
- [ ] **All three patterns present** - Strategic Narrative, Playing Field, Winning Moves sections exist
- [ ] **Strategic Narrative complete** - Includes Vision, North Star, Market Reality, Hypothesis, Urgency, Conviction (all 6 elements)
- [ ] **Playing Field complete** - Includes Audiences, Jobs, Alternatives
- [ ] **Winning Moves complete** - Includes Segments, Value Props, Channels, Differentiators, Trade-offs

**Required Sections:**
- [ ] **Risks & Mitigation table** - Table with Risk Category, Example Risk, Impact, Mitigation Strategy (minimum 3 risks)
- [ ] **Validation section** - Includes "Does this help us say NO?" with answer and evidence
- [ ] **Trade-offs explicit** - "What we're NOT doing" is clearly stated in Winning Moves

**Context Linkage:**
- [ ] **Vision linkage** - References or builds from vision in context/vision.md
- [ ] **Saved to context** - Saved to `context/strategy.md`

### Quality Checks

**Boundaries:**
- [ ] **Breadth defined** - Clear scope (one product, product line, or portfolio)
- [ ] **Time horizon stated** - Explicit timeframe (e.g., "next 12 months", "3-year strategy")

**Alignment:**
- [ ] **Acknowledges constraints** - References business, tech, or market constraints that shape choices
- [ ] **Coherent across patterns** - Strategic Narrative, Playing Field, and Winning Moves reinforce each other (not contradictory)

**Informed by Data:**
- [ ] **Market Reality is factual** - Verifiable market conditions, not opinions or assumptions
- [ ] **Data-backed claims** - Key assertions reference data sources or research (even if informal)

**Measurable:**
- [ ] **North Star is measurable** - Metric can actually be tracked
- [ ] **Success criteria clear** - Can determine if strategy is working

**Detailed and Actionable:**
- [ ] **Explains WHY** - Rationale for choices is clear (not just WHAT was chosen)
- [ ] **Specific, not vague** - Concrete choices, not platitudes like "be customer-focused"
- [ ] **Teams can act on it** - Specific enough to guide roadmap decisions

**Strategic Choice Tests:**
- [ ] **Says NO effectively** - Test: Can this strategy clearly reject a plausible adjacent initiative? If unclear, strategy lacks focus
- [ ] **Passes "opposite of stupid" test** - For each major choice: is the opposite a valid alternative (not obviously bad)? If opposite is stupid, it's not a real choice
- [ ] **Hypothesis is contrarian** - States a belief others don't hold (not "AI is important" but "AI agents can automate 85% of workflows")
- [ ] **Urgency creates focus** - Specific time window or reason for urgency, not vague "eventually"

**Differentiation:**
- [ ] **Decisive** - Makes clear choices, not trying to do everything
- [ ] **Differentiated** - Distinct from "copy what competitors do"
- [ ] **Conviction is testable** - "Why we'll win" can be validated with customer evidence

### Verification Process

1. Generate draft strategy document
2. Run all checks above
3. For each failed check:
   - **Can we fix with context we have?** → Regenerate silently
   - **Need user input?** → Ask specific question, then regenerate
4. Show progress: "Checking [criterion]... ✓ or ✗ [reason]"
5. Maximum 3 attempts per check
6. If still failing after 3 attempts → Proceed with warning: "⚠ Could not verify [criterion] after 3 attempts"
7. Present strategy with Eval Summary appended

### Eval Summary Format

Append to `context/strategy.md` and any strategy deliverable:

```markdown
