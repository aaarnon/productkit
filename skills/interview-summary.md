### 3. Experience Map

Visual drawing of the story showing:
- Key moments in sequence
- Emotional highs and lows
- Decision points
- Pain points along the journey

```
○──────○──────○──────○──────○
Start  Step   Step   Step   End
       (pain) (high) (pain)
```

### 4. Opportunities

Unmet needs, pain points, and desires uncovered:

## Opportunities vs Insights

| Opportunities | Insights |
|---------------|----------|

| "I need a faster way to..." | "Most users check reviews first" |

## Story-Based Interview Principles

When gathering material for summaries, ensure interviews follow these principles:

### Ask For
- Specific past events ("Tell me about the last time...")
- Concrete details and sequences
- How decisions were actually made
- Emotional reactions at key moments

### Avoid
- General behavior questions ("How often do you...?")
- Future-oriented questions ("Would you use...?")
- Hypothetical scenarios
- Leading questions

## Best Practices

### Timing
Create immediately after interview while details are fresh (within 15-20 minutes for experienced teams).

### Drawing the Map
> "Stories are narrative... But when we capture an interview participant's story, it rarely comes out that cleanly."

Drawing forces you to:
- Clarify narrative structure
- Identify gaps in understanding
- Spot critical moments
- See journey from their perspective

### Sharing
- Post to Slack, Notion, or shared drive
- Review snapshots as a team regularly
- Reference when prioritizing opportunities
- Revisit when targeting new work
