## 5-Step Positioning Exercise

### Step 1: Competitive Alternatives
What would customers use if your product didn't exist?
- Not just direct competitors
- Include "do nothing" or manual workarounds
- List all realistic alternatives

### Step 2: Unique Attributes
What features/capabilities do you have that alternatives lack?
- Focus on things that are truly different
- Technical, business model, or experience differences
- Be specific and concrete

### Step 3: Value (for Customers)
What benefit do those unique attributes provide?
- Translate features into customer outcomes
- Think about jobs-to-be-done
- Quantify where possible

### Step 4: Target Customer
Who cares most about that value?
- Best-fit customer characteristics
- Who has the problem most acutely
- Who gets most value from your differentiation

### Step 5: Market Category
What context makes your value obvious?
- Frame that positions you favorably
- Category where you can win
- May be existing category, subcategory, or new category

## Common Positioning Mistakes

1. **Too broad target** - "Everyone" is not a target
2. **Feature focus** - Lead with value, not features
3. **Competitor obsession** - Position against alternatives, not just competitors
4. **Wrong category** - Category that doesn't highlight your strengths
