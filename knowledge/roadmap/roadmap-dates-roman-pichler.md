## Introduction

Whether product roadmaps should show dates is a controversial topic. Some people passionately argue that dates should be banned from roadmaps. Others claim that they are useful. This article discusses the pros and cons of using dates on product roadmaps to help you decide which option is right for you.

## What is a Product Roadmap?

A roadmap is a high-level plan that states how a product is likely to evolve over the next six to 12 months. An effective, modern product roadmap focuses on the **outcomes and benefits** a product should provide. In other words, it is outcome-based and goal-oriented.

This differs from a traditional approach, which maps features onto a timeline.

## Benefits of Using Dates

Dates can be helpful for two main reasons:
1. They allow you to state deadlines
2. They help check if your current roadmap is realistic and actionable

### 1. Capture Deadlines

Some products must obey deadlines or a specific window of opportunity in order to achieve success.

**Examples:**

- **Seasonal products** (games, smartphones) - Main sales tend to take place prior to Christmas. Having the products ready on time is essential, as a delay would have a significant revenue impact.

- **Healthcare imaging devices** - A prototype might have to be available at the annual RSNA conference

- **Internal products** - May need to be released by a specific date to be able to achieve the desired business benefit

- **Release trains** - Coordinating multiple products or teams on a regular schedule for user improvements

### 2. Ensure Realism with the Iron Triangle

A handy tool for checking realism is the **Iron Triangle**.

```
        Goal Attainment
              /\
             /  \
            /    \
           / QUALITY\
          /  (fixed) \
         /____________\
    Date/              \Budget
   Timeline
```

**Key points:**
- The triangle takes into account: goal attainment, date/time frame, and budget
- **Quality** is placed in the middle to indicate it should be fixed
- **One vertex must always stay flexible** and act as a release valve to account for unforeseen events (Sod's Law)

**Questions to ask:**
- Should the roadmap goal be achieved, even if this means that it takes longer than anticipated?
- Or should the time be fixed, even if this means that the goal has to be scaled back?

## Drawbacks of Using Dates

Stating specific target dates comes with downsides:

1. **Stakeholders may treat dates as commitments** - Even if you clearly state they are estimates or targets, people tend to interpret them as fixed commitments

2. **Pressure on teams** - This can put development teams under pressure to work unsustainably, take shortcuts, and create technical debt

3. **Quality suffers** - Results in poorly implemented products that are hard and expensive to enhance

## Recommendations Based on Audience

### External Roadmaps (Customer-Facing)

**Recommendation: Do NOT state specific dates**

If you use a roadmap to communicate with customers—possibly to demonstrate that you are committed to the product and have some great ideas in the pipeline:

- Use big, coarse-grained time frames like **"first half of the year"** and **"second half of the year"**
- Or apply **Janna Bastow's Now-Next-Later approach**

**Why:** You still capture temporal information, but it is vague enough so that you don't commit to specific dates or narrow time frames. This avoids:
- Putting yourself and development teams under pressure
- Disappointing customers

### Internal Roadmaps

**Recommendation: Consider using specific time frames or dates**

If you use an internal product roadmap that guides the work of stakeholders and development teams:

**Why dates help internally:**
1. Helps you understand if your plan is realistic—if the contents can be delivered as expected
2. Communicates actual deadlines when they exist

## Key Practices

### Make Roadmap Creation Collaborative

Don't create a roadmap on your own. Create it with the development team and key stakeholders:
- Ensures buy-in
- Takes advantage of their knowledge

### Regularly Review and Adjust

- Review and adjust your roadmap together with the development team and stakeholders
- **At least once every quarter** as a rule of thumb
- A product roadmap is a **living document**
- Must be regularly updated to account for:
  - Development progress
  - User data and feedback
  - Changes in overall product strategy

## Summary

| Audience | Use Dates? | Approach |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **External/Customers** | No specific dates | Use broad timeframes (H1/H2, Now-Next-Later) |
| **Internal/Teams** | Yes, consider dates | Helps validate realism and communicate deadlines |

**The Iron Triangle trade-off:**
- When unforeseen events occur, decide which vertex is flexible
- Keep quality fixed
- Choose between extending timeline OR scaling back goals

**Remember:** Roadmaps are living documents that require quarterly review and collaboration.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Context matters** - The answer depends on your audience (internal vs external)
2. **Dates help validate realism** - Use the Iron Triangle to check feasibility
3. **Vague timeframes protect relationships** - For customers, use Now-Next-Later or half-year buckets
4. **Collaboration is essential** - Create roadmaps with teams and stakeholders, not alone
5. **Roadmaps evolve** - Review quarterly and treat as living documents
