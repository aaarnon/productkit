## Introduction

Roadmaps are a core product management tool. They provide visibility on what product teams are up to in an easily digestible format. Done well, they clearly express direction, ambition and progress. However, roadmaps are also a minefield, both because there are so many different formats favored by different people, and because drafted and executed poorly they burn credibility throughout an organization.

This guide provides six product roadmap templates, as well as practical advice on how to use roadmaps to influence and collaborate with those around you.

## What are product roadmaps for?

Roadmaps are a communication tool for engaging stakeholders in what you're up to as a product team. Everyone wants visibility into what your plans are, but why will vary from stakeholder to stakeholder:

- **Execs** – want to understand what the product strategy is, whether it's aligned with company strategy, and how well teams can deliver on it
- **Marketing and Sales** – want to know what features they can and should tell customers about, and which features will assist them to hit revenue goals
- **Customer Support** – need to know how the platform is changing in case of customer queries, and whether they need to update FAQs or internal processes to take this into account
- **Engineers** – want to know what they are working on, what platform changes impact their architecture, and of any dependencies they need to be aware of

### Two Levels of Detail

Broadly there are two levels of detail that people will want visibility on. You don't want to mix these:

1. **Strategic** – provides 12+ months of visibility, and illustrates the direction and ambition of the product team. At this level you are showing the main themes that will be tackled, and balance of work between them, but not specific features or timelines.

2. **Tactical** – provides up to 3 months visibility on specific features that will be released, with clear timelines that other teams can rely on. Here you can give more certainty on outputs or outcomes, but not both.

## Good Roadmap / Bad Roadmap

### Good roadmaps:

- Illustrate the product strategy
- Follow on from vision and clarity about what you want to achieve
- Build credibility by showing that product can keep commitments
- Generate buy-in, by showing product is aligned on the most important problems
- Articulate how outputs should generate the desired outcomes
- Vary in level of detail and scope depending on the audience
- Are clear about what is NOT going to get done

### Bad roadmaps:

- Don't follow a strategy, and are just a pick-n-mix of features to do
- Start the planning process, instead of finishing it
- Create a false sense of accuracy about what will be built, and when it will be shipped
- Destroy credibility of product teams as a result of this false accuracy
- Focus teams on outputs that are unattached to outcomes
- Are never rarely updated and frequently out-of-date

## Principles for product roadmaps and prioritization

### Strategy is a balance of themes, not a sequence of features

At a high level, strategy is a question of resource allocation. Given a multitude of possibilities and limited resources, you have to decide where to spend your time. High quality strategic discussions make these trade offs explicit:

- How much of your time do you want to focus on one strategic pillar over another?
- How much on strengthening your USPs vs. covering competitor functionality?
- How happy are you with the balance of work that has been shipped in the last 12 months?
- How do you reallocate teams to reflect the decisions you've made?

### Recognise if you're in a red phase or a blue phase

Product teams have two different modes of working. Both are valid, but require contrasting approaches:

**Red phases** are when you're working on a big strategic project. A high level decision has been made to commit to this project, and there's conviction across the business in its ability to drive outcomes. Your job is to deliver certainty around scope and timelines, and a more tactical roadmap like a gantt chart will be most appropriate.

**Blue phases** are when you are working more autonomously, and on the hook for results. It's your responsibility to figure out what needs to be built to create value. Here you need to emphasize discovery, and how you are managing the uncertainty you face. A roadmap like Now / Next / Later will be your best bet.

Using red phase tactics in a blue phase will look like a spectacular lack of vision and ambition. Using blue phase tactics in a red phase will look egotistical, obstructive and like you don't understand the bigger picture.

### Choose between predictability of outputs and outcomes

When things go wrong, ask:

- Do you understand the problem as well as you thought you did?
- How important, and how risky, are the next themes in the roadmap?
- Is it more important to ship what you said you would, or drive the outcomes you committed to?

Two courses of action:

- Stick to your roadmap and move on to other themes (more red phase). You're valuing predictability of output over the importance of delivering a given outcome.
- Stay focused on the current theme, and blow out the roadmap until you deliver the outcome you want (more blue phase). Stakeholders know you can't offer predictability.

### Prioritize the big bets first

Impact does not come uniformly from product work. Always start with planning the big pieces of work that could deliver transformational impact, or that you've made a public commitment to shipping – these are your rocks. You'll still be able to squeeze some pebbles and sand in around the edges.

### Frameworks only take you so far

Creating a roadmap and prioritizing work is rarely neat and straight forward. There are no silver bullets. The tough decisions are more likely to be between two big projects each with the potential to transform the business, when you only have time for one.

## Product Roadmap Templates

### Strategic Templates:

**1. Strategic Product Roadmap Template**
- **Type:** Strategic
- **Best for:** Resource allocation in annual planning
- Shows how product strategy will translate into action over 12+ months
- Emphasizes resource allocation and balance of work over timelines

**Good when you:**
- Want to align on resource allocation at a high level
- Want to align on the balance of work, and when big themes will get tackled

**Bad when you:**
- Want to know details of what a team will ship in the near future
- Need certainty over when certain features will land

**2. Now / Next / Later Product Roadmap Template**
- **Type:** Strategic
- **Best for:** Teams with few dependencies and tackling areas of high uncertainty
- Maximizes autonomy and flexibility
- Teams don't need to commit to specific timelines

**Good when you:**
- Are dealing with a lot of uncertainty and want to focus on discovery
- Have an autonomous team that doesn't have other teams relying on it
- Are confident in the capabilities of the team

**Bad when you:**
- Need to coordinate launches with other functional teams
- Have high confidence in what you need to build (e.g. "red phase")
- Don't have credibility across the organization yet

**3. Hybrid Roadmap Template**
- **Type:** Hybrid
- **Best for:** High level comms when you need to balance resource allocation and timelines
- Falls somewhere between Now Next Later and Gantt chart
- Most commonly used format for roadmaps at executive and board level

**Good when you:**
- Have competing demands from stakeholders that you need to satisfy with a single roadmap
- Want something simple and intuitive for people to read

**Bad when you:**
- Want to know exactly what a team will ship in the near future
- Need to coordinate delivery timelines between teams
- Have no idea what you will build 6+ months out

### Tactical Templates:

**4. Dashboard Product Roadmap Template**
- **Type:** Tactical
- **Best for:** Quarterly progress for several teams
- Shows overall progress of multiple teams in one glance
- Combines outcomes (top half) with delivery view (bottom half)

**Good when you:**
- Have multiple teams, and want to provide a quick update on all of them
- Want to balance predictability and flexibility for the teams

**Bad when you:**
- Need certainty on whether particular pieces of work will land on given dates
- Want to track performance of individual teams in detail

**5. OKR Product Roadmap**
- **Type:** Tactical
- **Best for:** Detailed view of a single team
- Tracks key results (outcomes) at the same time as initiatives (outputs)
- Week-by-week progress tracking

**Good when you:**
- Are running an OKR process across the company already
- Want detailed week-by-week view on team performance
- Are comfortable treating initiatives as ideas and not commitments

**Bad when you:**
- Want a high level snapshot across multiple teams
- Want a long term view
- Need something stakeholders can easily understand in moments

**6. Gantt Roadmap**
- **Type:** Tactical
- **Best for:** Complex project with multiple teams
- Classic project management format
- Shows how multiple streams of work are paced against each other

**Good when you:**
- Are coordinating multiple workstreams or teams, especially with dependencies
- Are in a red phase, committed to outputs
- Need high degree of precision about what will ship when
- Are looking at the next 3 months or less

**Bad when you:**
- Have low confidence in what to build, and want to test, learn and iterate
- Need visibility beyond 3 months
- Haven't fully scoped and estimated the features
- Are in a blue phase

### The Gantt Chart Vicious Cycle

Gantt charts are particularly susceptible at creating vicious cycles that destroy product team credibility when used incorrectly:

1. Product team is forced to create roadmap to show what will happen when
2. Timelines show a false level of accuracy, because the team doesn't know what it will be building
3. Timelines are missed, and features don't deliver expected results
4. Credibility is tanked, and leaders demand more certainty
5. Product team forced to create a roadmap that shows what will happen when…

## Summary

Picking the right roadmap allows you to show stakeholders your direction, strategy and progress in a clear way that facilitates productive conversations.

Don't get suckered into providing false levels of certainty by mixing the strategic and tactical levels, and adjust the format of the roadmap you use depending on the audience and timeline you're discussing.
