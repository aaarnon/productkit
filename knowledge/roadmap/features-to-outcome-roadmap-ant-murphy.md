## Core Insight

Most teams have feature lists, not roadmaps. The difference is **narrative** — the strategic "why" that connects work items into coherent direction.

> "A great product roadmap doesn't just outline WHAT you're doing, it also explains the WHY."

Without narratives, teams default to scoring frameworks (RICE, WSJF) as proxies for strategy. That's stack-ranking, not roadmapping.

## The 5 Steps

### Step 1: Bring Out Your Dead

Collect everything into one place.

**What to gather:**
- Jira tickets
- Confluence pages
- Sticky notes
- Slack requests
- Customer feedback
- Sales asks

**Don't worry about:**
- Format
- Duplicates
- Quality

Just get it all visible.

---

### Step 2: Extract Narratives

This is the critical step that transforms features into strategy.

**For each item, ask:**
1. "Why is this here?"
2. "Why can't it be done sooner or later?"

**What you're looking for:**
- Common themes
- Shared strategic intent
- Clusters that belong together

**Example:**
- Feature A: Add SSO → *Why?* Enterprise customers need it
- Feature B: Audit logs → *Why?* Enterprise compliance
- Feature C: Role permissions → *Why?* Enterprise security

**Narrative:** "Enterprise readiness" — these features share strategic purpose.

---

### Step 3: Prioritize Narratives

Organize narrative clusters, not individual features.

**Use Now-Next-Later:**

| Horizon | What Goes Here |
|---------|----------------|
| **Now** | Narratives we're committed to |
| **Next** | Narratives coming after Now |
| **Later** | Narratives on the horizon |

**Important:**
- Avoid premature time-boxing
- Document reasoning behind prioritization
- Narratives compete, not features

---

### Step 4: Map the Work

Only now assign features to narratives.

**Process:**
1. Take each feature from Step 1
2. Assign to the narrative it supports
3. Features without a narrative → question if they belong

**Warning signs:**
- Features that don't fit any narrative
- Narratives with no supporting features
- One narrative with 80% of features (too broad)

---

### Step 5: Add Outcomes

Define success for each narrative.

**For each narrative cluster:**
- What does success look like?
- How will we measure it?
- What signals progress?

**Validate alignment:**
- Does this connect to company goals?
- Will stakeholders recognize this as strategic?

## Strategy vs Scorecards

| Approach | What It Produces |
|----------|------------------|
| **Feature scoring** (RICE, WSJF) | Stack-ranked list of disconnected items |
| **Narrative roadmap** | Coherent strategic direction with "why" |

**The trap:** Teams use scoring frameworks as proxy for strategy. High RICE score ≠ strategic importance.

**The fix:** Narratives first, then prioritize within narratives.

---

## Before & After

**Before (Feature List):**
```
1. SSO integration (RICE: 85)
2. Dark mode (RICE: 72)
3. Audit logs (RICE: 68)
4. Mobile app (RICE: 65)
5. Role permissions (RICE: 61)
```

**After (Outcome Roadmap):**
```
NOW: Enterprise Readiness
├── SSO integration
├── Audit logs
└── Role permissions
Outcome: Close 3 enterprise deals in Q2

NEXT: User Experience
├── Dark mode
└── Mobile app
Outcome: Increase daily engagement by 20%
```

Same features, but now with strategic coherence.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|-------------|
| Skipping Step 2 | No narratives = no strategy |
| Prioritizing features before narratives | Loses strategic coherence |
| Using RICE as strategy | Scoring ≠ direction |
| Too many narratives | Lack of focus (3-5 max) |
| Narratives without outcomes | Can't measure success |

---

## Implications for This System

**For Roadmap agent:**
- Guide users through 5 steps sequentially
- Emphasize Step 2 (Extract Narratives) as critical
- Challenge roadmaps that are just scored feature lists
- Ensure outcomes are defined for each narrative

**For Strategy agent:**
- Narratives should connect to strategic pillars
- If narratives aren't clear, strategy isn't clear

**For Prioritization skill:**
- Scoring frameworks work WITHIN narratives
- Don't use RICE to compare across narratives

> "A great product roadmap doesn't just outline WHAT you're doing, it also explains the WHY."

> "Without narrative foundations, teams resort to stack-ranking disparate ideas rather than building coherent strategic direction."
