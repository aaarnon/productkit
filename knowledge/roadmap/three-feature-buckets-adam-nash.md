## Core Insight

Every feature on your roadmap should fit into one of three buckets. A healthy roadmap has items from **all three** — missing any bucket signals organizational gaps.

---

## The Three Buckets

| Bucket | Purpose | Evaluation |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Metrics Movers** | Move the business needle | Did metrics improve? |
| **Customer Requests** | Address what users ask for | Did satisfaction improve? |
| **Customer Delight** | Surprise users positively | Did users love it? |

---

## Bucket 1: Metrics Movers

Features designed to significantly impact business and product metrics.

**Examples:**
- Growth features (virality, acquisition)
- Engagement features (retention, frequency)
- Revenue features (conversion, ARPU)

**Characteristics:**
- Rare — not every feature moves metrics
- Should be identified upfront
- Success is measurable
- Strategic alignment required

**Warning:** If your roadmap has no metrics movers, your strategy execution is weak.

---

## Bucket 2: Customer Requests

Features customers actively ask for.

**Why this matters:**
- Users invested time giving feedback
- Ignoring requests frustrates loyal users
- Shows you're listening
- Builds trust and retention

**Characteristics:**
- Usually clear — users tell you directly
- May not move metrics dramatically
- Keeps existing users happy
- Table stakes for mature products

**Warning:** If your roadmap has no customer requests, your feedback channels are broken.

---

## Bucket 3: Customer Delight

Unexpected features that surprise users positively.

**Requirements to create delight:**
1. Deep understanding of customer pain points
2. Technological knowledge of what's possible
3. Innovative design thinking
4. Willingness to take creative risks

**Characteristics:**
- Users didn't ask for it (didn't know to ask)
- Solves problems elegantly
- Creates "wow" moments
- Differentiates from competitors

**Warning:** If your roadmap has no delight features, your innovation capability is limited.

## Resource Allocation

> "Optimal success comes from packaging up items from each of these buckets."

### Balanced Roadmap

Every major release (or quarterly roadmap) should include:

| Bucket | Rough Allocation |
|--------|------------------|
| Metrics Movers | ~40% |
| Customer Requests | ~30% |
| Customer Delight | ~30% |

*Note: Allocations vary by company stage and strategy.*

### Why Balance Matters

| If You Skip... | Signal |
|----------------|--------|
| Metrics Movers | Weak strategy execution |
| Customer Requests | Poor feedback channels |
| Customer Delight | Innovation limitations |

---

## Applying to Different Cadences

The framework works regardless of release frequency:

| Cadence | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Weekly releases | Balance across 3-month roadmap |
| Monthly releases | Each release should touch all buckets |
| Quarterly releases | Major releases need all three |

---

## Using the Framework

### For Roadmap Planning

1. **Categorize existing backlog** into three buckets
2. **Identify gaps** — which bucket is underrepresented?
3. **Balance each planning cycle** to include all three
4. **Review retrospectively** — did we deliver on all buckets?

### For Feature Prioritization

When comparing features:
- Don't just compare within buckets
- Ensure each bucket gets representation
- A metrics mover shouldn't always beat a delight feature

### For Team Health

Missing buckets reveal organizational problems:

| Missing | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|------------|-----|
| Metrics Movers | No clear strategy or metrics | Define success metrics, align to strategy |
| Customer Requests | No feedback loop | Build research/support feedback channels |
| Customer Delight | No innovation culture | Create space for experimentation |

---

## Intellectual Honesty

The framework forces clarity on **why** features are prioritized:

> "Teams should use this framework for intellectual honesty about why features are prioritized."

Every feature should have a clear bucket:
- "This is a metrics mover because we expect X% lift in retention"
- "This is a customer request — our top 3 requested feature"
- "This is a delight feature — users don't know they need this yet"

If you can't categorize a feature, question why it's on the roadmap.

---

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

| Framework | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **DHM** | Metrics Movers often address Margin; Delight addresses Delight; Requests can be any |
| **Four Types of Work** | Feature Work spans all buckets; Growth Work is often Metrics Movers |
| **70:20:10** | Metrics Movers in 70%; Delight can be in 20% or 10% |
| **OKRs** | Metrics Movers directly support KRs; others support qualitative objectives |

---

## Implications for This System

**For Roadmap agent:**
- Use three buckets to evaluate roadmap health
- Flag imbalanced roadmaps
- Ensure each planning cycle touches all buckets

**For Prioritization skill:**
- Don't compare only within buckets
- Balance representation across buckets
- Use bucket categorization as prioritization input

**For Discovery agent:**
- Customer requests come from discovery
- Delight features require deep customer understanding
- Metrics movers need clear success metrics
