# Part 1: Background, Theory and Process

## TL;DR

Roadmaps, actual strategic roadmaps, when created correctly are an incredibly valuable tool to define direction, create alignment and bring focus within a company. Sadly, most companies and Product teams create artifacts that they call "roadmaps", but which are really just wishful thinking delivery plans with little connection to overall business objectives and strategy.

Creating strategic roadmaps is neither complex nor time-consuming, but it does require a different way of working than what most companies follow. The change to make is to start with clear objectives (which many companies don't have), then make strategy choices (also missing in many companies) on how to achieve those objectives. Those choices will define the key actions or activities that will be visible on the roadmap. As I said, not hard, just different.

The benefit of this approach is that there is a clear, explicit connection between business objectives and important product work (and non-product work) that must be done. It creates alignment and reduces the potential for distractions as new "shiny objects" appear.

## Introduction: The Roadmap Problem

The word roadmap is one of those terms that has a common language definition but also has an industry-specific definition. Sadly, that's not the case with the word roadmap, when used in business, and especially in the Product context.

### Defining a Roadmap

The dictionary definition of roadmap is:

**roadmap:** n. any plan or guide to show how something is arranged or can be accomplished.

While this is a good common language definition, we (in Product) need to realize that "any plan or guide…" is not at all sufficient for our needs. A roadmap is NOT a plan. When thinking about a (Product) Roadmap, we need to be able to easily distinguish it from a (Product) Plan. The two are NOT the same.

In Product — **a Roadmap is a strategy document.**

#### Various Definitions

> "A roadmap is a statement of direction and strategy." (as opposed to a plan which is a statement of commitment and delivery.)

Janna Bastow, founder of ProdPad states:

> "A roadmap is a prototype of your strategy."

According to Steve Johnson at Product Growth Leaders:

> "Roadmaps are evidence of strategy. Not a list of features".

**The common element in all of these definitions is STRATEGY.** A roadmap is a strategy document. It is NOT a delivery plan.

**The key point is that roadmaps are AN OUTPUT of a strategy process, visualized and represented for clarity and communication.**

## Purpose of a Strategic Roadmap

> "The biggest benefit and purpose of a roadmap is to identify priorities and direction. So, where you're going and what's most important. And the basis for that comes from strategy and objectives…clearly thinking that through and communicating it to others."

A roadmap is not about delivery and commitment. A well executed roadmap will have a story behind it that you can use to communicate to others. That story is based on the objectives (what you want to achieve) and the strategy (choices on what you will/won't do) to achieve those objectives.

**Objectives/Strategy provide focus and clarity on what is important.** This process, if adopted, will prevent you from being distracted by shiny objects or 'strategy of the week' situations.

## What a Roadmap is NOT

### 1. A Roadmap is NOT a list of features to build

This is probably the biggest problem and misconception with most roadmaps. As Steve Johnson said "It's not a list of features."

**If it wasn't explicitly created based on clear objectives and strategy choices, then it's NOT a roadmap.**

**NOTE:** Exceptions are possible. If features are an output of the strategy process, that's fine. The point is that the roadmap is NOT simply a list of features to be developed.

### 2. A roadmap is NOT a list of commitments

Another misconception many people have about roadmaps — actual STRATEGIC roadmaps — is that they are a list of commitments.

A roadmap is a projection into the future of our intentions based on what we want to achieve (objectives), how we believe we can achieve those objectives (strategy) and what we know today. But this will likely change as market/company conditions change, and as we learn more.

### 3. A roadmap is NOT a bucket we fill with work items

Given that the roadmap is the OUTPUT of a process, we can't add things to it just because someone important asks (or demands it).

#### Document the WHY

Everything we commit to should be done with a clear understanding of WHY. That WHY could be objectives and strategy or an external reason not under our control (e.g. regulatory requirements) — i.e. good reasons for WHY. But it could also be because a leader said so — i.e. not so good reasons for WHY.

> "One does not simply put things 'on the roadmap'."

## The Vision Stack

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Vision** | Top-level direction for the product (formal or informal) |
| **Objectives** | Defined targets that align with the Vision and move towards it |
| **Strategy** | Aligned set of choices made to achieve those Objectives |
| **Roadmaps** | Key action items coming out of strategy choices |
| **Plans** | Detailed, refined, and augmented shorter-term execution items |

**Key Insights:**
- The topline direction for any product is set via the Vision
- Each layer feeds into the one below it, creating alignment
- Objectives that don't align with the Vision should be avoided
- The most critical connection is between Business and Product Objectives

## What is Strategy?

### Roger Martin's Definition

**strategy:** n. an integrated set of choices that work together and reinforce each other. The result positions the organization on a playing field in the best way possible.

The key words are **integrated choices**, **reinforce**, and **positions**.

- **Integrated choices** — Strategy is choice. We choose what to do, and thus what not do. If you're not making a choice, it's not a strategy. And those choices are "integrated" — they align and support each other.

- **Reinforce** — those choices must work together and reinforce each other. They must have coherence.

- **Positions** — The integrated choices place the company (or product) in a position to win.

### The Everything, Everywhere All at Once Problem

Many companies and leaders don't want to make these choices. They (falsely) believe it might constrain them. But unless you make those choices — coherent, intentional, integrated choices — you are still going to make choices, almost certainly weaker, less coherent, and less integrated ones — or end up doing a bit of everything.

## Objectives — What Are You Trying To Achieve?

You need to start with what you want to achieve and have clarity and alignment on it.

There is a clear connection between Objectives — Strategy — Roadmap. You can't create a (strategic) roadmap out of thin air.

### Defining Good Objectives

**Objective:** n. a specific, measurable, time-bound target or aspiration you wish to achieve.

Good objectives must have (at minimum) three attributes:

- **Specific** (S)
- **Measurable** (M)
- **Time-bound** (T)

### Example

"Reduce average activation time from three weeks to two weeks" sounds good, but it is missing the time-bound part. **By when?** In one month? In three months? In six months?

The answer matters. If the target is one month, that requires a very different set of choices than if the target is six months.

## The Strategy Process That Creates a Roadmap

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Define a clear SMT objective you want to achieve |
| 2 | Understand the market or customer context related to this objective |
| 3 | Identify a variety of different options you might pursue |
| 4 | Use questions: "What Do We Know" (WDWK), "What Would Have To Be True?" (WWHTBT) and "How Might We?" (HMW) |
| 5 | For each action, identify implicit assumptions that could prevent success |
| 6 | Test those assumptions to increase confidence |
| 7 | Make your choices on which approaches/actions you will take |
| 8 | Sequence those actions over time (in rough time buckets, not dates) |
| 9 | Repeat this process for any other objectives |

**Once you've done this for all your objectives (there should only be a few), you'll have your first cut at your strategic roadmap.**

# Part 2: Detailed Example and Application

## A Working Example

### Start with a clear SMT Objective

The specific Business Objective is:

**Increase our revenue in Mexico by 35% in CY 2025**

This is clearly a Business Objective. It is **Specific** (Increase revenue in Mexico), **Measurable** (by 35%) and **Time-bound** (in 2025).

### Context for the Objective

AutoDataTest is a scaleup that sells a software product to test enterprise data. It has an existing reseller and implementation partner in Mexico. The partner has indicated strong competition and cited the product's complex onboarding process as a barrier. There's also a need for new integrations. The partner cannot increase their results by 35% on their own.

### How Might We: Increase Revenue

Options identified:

1. Increase product prices
2. Add more products to sell
3. Find additional reseller partners
4. Drive more marketing
5. Help the existing partner increase deal size or sales volume
6. Incent the partner to hire more sales people
7. Provide additional sales training for the partner
8. Add new integrations
9. Open an office in Mexico and sell/support directly

### Assumptions and Risks

After evaluation, the company decided NOT to do 1, 2 and 3:

- **Price increase** — not possible given competitive pressures
- **Adding more products** — couldn't be done fast enough for 2025
- **Finding more resellers** — requires too much lead time and would cause channel conflict

### The Strategy Choices

> In order to achieve the objective (35% increase in revenue in 2025), the company is going to:
> 1. **Set up a direct sales office in Mexico**
> 2. **Collaborate with the partner** (training, deal size, reach)
> 3. **Launch an extended marketing effort**
> 4. **Add better onboarding capabilities and content**
> 5. **Investigate additional integrations**

**NOTE:** This strategy is a bet. These choices don't guarantee the 35% revenue increase, but the company believes they are the best choices to achieve that objective AND to set the company up for future success.

## Business Roadmaps vs. Product Roadmaps

When people say "roadmap" they usually mean a product roadmap. But there is no rule that states a roadmap can only be applied to products.

A **business roadmap** is a representation of your business strategy, laid out visually with time-frames. The items in nearer timeframes should be higher confidence, and those further out lower confidence.

## The Complete Strategic Roadmap

| Strategy Choice | Months 1-3 | Months 4-6 | Months 7-12 |
|----------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Set up office in Mexico** | Understand market opportunity; Set up business; Start recruitment (country manager) | Secure office space; Continue recruitment; Coordinate GTM with partner | Formally launch operations; Hire/train local teams; Evaluate progress |
| **Sales collaboration with partner** | Assess partner operations; Address weaknesses; Define target metrics | Implement training; Co-sell on larger deals; Perform Win/Loss | Joint pipeline reviews; Advanced training; Continue Win/Loss |
| **Extended marketing efforts** | Understand partner marketing; Create plan; Begin office launch planning | Continue marketing activities; Track funnel; Prepare for office launch | Continue activities; Execute office launch marketing |
| **Better onboarding (Product)** | Investigate issues; Identify scope and solutions | Implement product/content changes | Track and measure; Make adjustments |
| **Additional integrations (Product)** | Investigate Mexican market needs; Conduct Loss analysis | Implement needed integrations | Monitor market needs; Factor into plans |

### Key Insights

**This is NOT a plan** — it has to be scoped out in more detail — and it is NOT a list of commitments. It is a hypothesis based on current understanding.

**It can be updated as needed** — As more facts become apparent, the company may learn things that require changes.

**More than product delivery** — Notice that Product rows include discovery and follow-up activities, not just deliverables.

**Business and product are connected** — There is a CLEAR and EXPLICIT connection between actions and objectives.

**A small number of objectives (please)** — Once you map out what it takes to properly achieve a strategic objective, it becomes clear that more than 2-3 big objectives are not manageable.

## The Product Roadmap

Product specific choices from each business objective can be combined together to create the Product Roadmap.

It will still have a connection to the objectives and you should still track and review the Business roadmap in entirety. But the Product fraction of the Business roadmap is what the Product teams can focus on.

## How Roadmaps Contribute to Plans

The roadmap is NOT a plan. A plan is scoped out in detail with target dates and allocated resources.

The items in the first column (e.g. Months 1–3) can be scoped out by each responsible team with action items assigned to people or teams to complete. In addition to the roadmap work, there will be other work that teams do — the "keep the lights on" work.

For a Product team, the Product Roadmap items, along with bug fixes, customer requests, maintenance etc. are what gets done. It's important to balance all this, and ensure that over time the strategic roadmap items are not ignored or pushed aside for tactical issues.

Every release consists of:
- Elements from your roadmap (strategic)
- Elements supporting other tactical priorities

The majority of work completed should be strategy/roadmap aligned.

## Summary

1. **Start with clear SMT objectives** — Specific, Measurable, Time-bound
2. **Make integrated strategy choices** — Coherent decisions that reinforce each other
3. **Roadmap is output of strategy** — Not a feature list or delivery commitment
4. **Business roadmap contains product roadmap** — Product work is subset of business strategy
5. **Plans come from roadmaps** — Detailed execution follows strategic direction
6. **Update as needed** — Roadmaps are hypotheses that evolve with learning
