## Overview: How do strategy, vision, mission, goals, and roadmap all work together?

| Level | Element | Key Question |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| 1 (Base) | Mission | What are we trying to achieve? |
| 2 | Vision | What does the world (or our product) look like when we've achieved it? |
| 3 | Strategy | What's our plan to achieve it, i.e. to win? |
| 4 | Goals | How will we measure progress? |
| 5 (Top) | Roadmap | What do we need to build in order to get there? |
| 6 | Task | What's one unit of work we can tackle next? |

**Key Insight:** The pyramid shows strategic planning flows from bottom (mission) to top (roadmap). Mission forms the foundation—the "why" that everything else builds upon. Strategy sits in the middle, bridging aspirational goals with tactical execution.

## 1. Mission

**Start here:** Why does your team (or company) even exist? What are you trying to achieve? What is your purpose?

### Examples of Great Missions

| Company | Mission |
|---------|---------|
| Tesla | Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy |
| TED | Spread ideas |
| Stripe | Increase the GDP of the internet |
| IKEA | Create a better everyday life for the many people |
| Patagonia | Use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis |
| Slack | Make work life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive |
| Google | Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful |
| World Wildlife Fund | Conserve nature and reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth |
| Nike | Do everything possible to expand human potential |
| Square | Make commerce easy |

## 2. Vision

**What does the world (or your product) look like when you've achieved your mission?**

### Examples of Great Vision Statements

| Company | Vision |
|---------|--------|
| Microsoft | A computer on every desk and in every home |
| Alzheimer's Association | A world without Alzheimer's disease |
| Teach for America | One day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education |
| Tesla | Create the most compelling car company of the 21st century |
| Lyft | A world where cities feel small again. Where transportation and tech bring people together, instead of apart |
| Netflix | Become the best global entertainment distribution service |

**Note:** If you start with your vision before your mission, that's totally OK. Elon Musk likely started with a vision of the world he wanted to see and then developed his mission around that. Don't overthink it.

## 3. Strategy

**Your strategy is simply your plan to achieve your vision—your plan to win.**

A strategy is essentially a short description of your plan, with 3 to 5 concrete investments that, if you get right, will bring you closer to winning (i.e. achieving your vision).

### High-Level Strategy Examples

**Tesla:**
1. Build a high-priced sports car
2. Use that revenue to build an affordable car
3. Use that revenue to build an even more affordable car
4. While doing so, also provide zero-emission electric power

**Uber:**
1. Launch Uber Black
2. Bring prices down by launching UberX
3. Bring prices down by launching Uber Pool
4. Bring prices down by launching scooters, bikes, etc.

**Substack:**
1. Build powerful publishing tools for writers
2. Help writers become better writers through value-add services
3. Grow their audience through network effects

### Real-Life Strategy Examples

| Company | Notable Elements |
|---------|-----------------|
| **GitLab** | Clear mission, vision, and three-part strategy |
| **Salesforce** | Simple, but tells you exactly what needs to be done |
| **Yahoo's "Peanut Butter" Memo** | Clearly identifies the problem, includes a three-part strategy. Now known as the "Peanut Butter Manifesto" |
| **Tesla Master Plan** | Narrative style, detailed problem identification, simple yet ambitious four-step strategy |

### Opportunity Solution Tree (Teresa Torres)

A great framework to think through and communicate strategy:

```
Desired Outcome (top)
    ├── Opportunity
    │   ├── Opportunity
    │   │   ├── Solution → Experiment
    │   │   └── Solution → Experiment
    │   └── Opportunity
    ├── Opportunity
    │   └── Opportunity
    │       └── Solution → Experiment
    └── Opportunity
```

**Key Insights:**
- Visualizes how a single desired outcome can be achieved through multiple opportunity paths
- Multiple opportunities should be considered before committing to solutions
- Experiments validate solutions before full implementation
- Encourages exploring alternatives rather than jumping to first ideas

---

## 4. Goals

**Goals are simply a way to measure the progress of your strategy toward achieving your ultimate vision.**

### Vision → Goal Examples

| Vision | Associated Goal |
|--------|-----------------|
| Microsoft: A computer on every desk and in every home | X% of homes with a computer |
| Teach for America: One day, all children will have opportunity for excellent education | X% of children with education |
| Alzheimer's Association: A world without Alzheimer's disease | X% decrease in Alzheimer's cases |

## 5. Roadmap

**Once you have your goals, you can align around and prioritize a roadmap.**

### Roadmap Structure

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Header | Vision statement + Quarterly goal |
| Projects | Organized by levels/stages |
| Columns | Status, Owner, Priority, Effort, Impact, Notes |
| Status tracking | On Hold → Needs 1-Pager → Needs Design → Needs Engineering → In Engineering → Experiment Running → Launched |

**Why goals before roadmap?** When prioritizing ideas, you look at ROI—effort vs. impact. The **impact** you're prioritizing against is based on how much you expect the project will impact your **goals**.

---

## 6. Tasks

**Within the roadmap, you break out individual tasks—the atomic unit of work for your teammates.**

---

## Complete Example: Tesla

```
TODAY → STRATEGY → VISION

Strategy (sequential phases):
1. Build high-priced sports car (Model S) → Goal: Deliver 4.3k cars
2. Use that money to build affordable car (Model X) → Goal: Deliver 15k cars
3. Build even more affordable car (Model 3) → Goal: Deliver 5k cars/week
4. Provide zero-emission electric power-generation options

Vision: "Create the most compelling car company of the 21st century"

Roadmap: All the specific work needed to execute the strategy
```

**Key Insight:** Strategy is sequential—each phase funds the next. Specific delivery targets make goals measurable.

## Summary

| Element | Question | Output |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Mission | Why do we exist? | Purpose statement |
| Vision | What does success look like? | Future state description |
| Strategy | How will we win? | 3-5 concrete investments |
| Goals | How do we measure progress? | Metrics and targets |
| Roadmap | What do we build? | Prioritized projects |
| Task | What's next? | Atomic units of work |

**The flow:** Mission → Vision → Strategy → Goals → Roadmap → Task

That's basically your plan as a product team, from the 10,000-foot mission to the day-to-day work of your team.
