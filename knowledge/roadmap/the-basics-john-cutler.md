## Overview

Product teams don't need excessive process overhead—just a "minimally viable" version of eight fundamental elements to outperform most organizations.

> "The boring bits can be so important."

Stability in fundamentals prevents reactivity and circular spinning, enabling teams to learn what actually works.

---

## The Eight Basics

### 1. Charter and Mission

Define:
- Who the team serves
- Why they matter
- Operating principles
- Working agreements

**Key insight:** Advocate for stable focus areas spanning multiple years (except in tiny startups).

---

### 2. Strategy

Create an actual strategy rather than attempting "all things to all people."

**Reference:** Richard Rumelt's work on distinguishing good from bad strategy.

**Key insight:** Implementation of the other basics helps validate what's working in your strategy.

---

### 3. Models

Develop "a couple" of models serving as connective tissue between your strategy and your roadmap.

**Purpose:** Help teams evolve from high-level direction to executable work.

---

### 4. One-Year Roadmap

Maintain an always-current roadmap filled with "suitably detailed bets."

**Key principle:** Detail emerges "at the last responsible moment, and not before"—a year's worth of work without requiring premature specificity.

---

### 5. Bet Artifacts

Each bet requires:
- A one-pager
- Research folder
- Learning backlog
- Core and extended teams
- An advocate

**Sizing guidance:**
- 1-3 month bets → Write one-pagers
- Longer efforts → Breakdown plus a 3-6 page parent bet overview

---

### 6. Bet-Specific Metrics

Track internal workings unique to the bet:
- Error rates
- Workflow completion time
- Interface usage
- Cohort-specific data

**Key insight:** Separate these from broader input metrics.

---

### 7. Input Metrics

Identify "persistent" targets that remain stable across quarters/years.

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple bets will target the same input(s) over time
- Stable across longer time horizons

**Example:** "% of users completing high-value actions within first two weeks"

---

### 8. Kickoffs and Learning Reviews

Two critical rituals per bet:
1. **Kickoffs** — Well-facilitated start to each bet
2. **Learning reviews** — Analyze impact and key lessons

**Key insight:** Frequent reviews benefit longer initiatives.

---

## Supporting Structure

### Goals
Teams choose between:
- Bet-specific goals
- Quarterly goals spanning multiple bets

OKRs may apply or prove unnecessary—context dependent.

### Continuous Improvement
Establish a reflection mechanism:
- POPCORN methodology recommended
- Review past experiments
- Prioritize small improvements

## Summary

| Basic | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Charter & Mission** | Define who you serve and why |
| **Strategy** | Make real choices, not "all things to all people" |
| **Models** | Connect strategy to roadmap |
| **One-Year Roadmap** | Detailed bets, emerging specificity |
| **Bet Artifacts** | One-pagers, research, learning backlog |
| **Bet-Specific Metrics** | Track internal workings unique to bet |
| **Input Metrics** | Persistent targets across quarters/years |
| **Kickoffs & Reviews** | Critical rituals for learning |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Minimally viable process** — Eight basics is enough to outperform most orgs
2. **Stability over reactivity** — Consistent fundamentals prevent spinning
3. **Last responsible moment** — Detail emerges when needed, not before
4. **Separate metrics** — Bet-specific vs persistent input metrics
5. **Learning rituals** — Kickoffs and reviews are non-negotiable
6. **Boring is important** — Fundamentals matter more than flashy frameworks
