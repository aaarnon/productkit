## Core Insight

Product strategy doesn't exist in isolation. It starts with company strategy (strategic intents) and flows down to how the product contributes to organizational goals.

## Step 1: Get to Company Strategy

### Start with the Investment Thesis

Connect the product with its intended outcome:
- **Why does this company exist?** (from investor perspective)
- **How does our product develop and grow to meet these objectives?**
- **What are we going to build to get there?**

### Company-Level Questions

| Question | What You're Validating |
|----------|------------------------|
| Do we know the problem we want to solve? | Problem clarity |
| Do we know how we want to be differentiated? | Positioning |
| Do we have a strong company vision? | Direction |

If any of these are unclear → work on company strategy first, not product strategy.

## Step 2: Know Your Customer

### The Discovery Process

1. **Identify focus personas**
   - Who are the personas we're targeting?
   - Be specific — not "everyone"

2. **Analyze current performance**
   - Where are we winning?
   - Where are we losing?
   - Check current data for patterns

3. **Form hypotheses**
   - Based on data, make hypotheses about segments
   - Prepare to validate with real conversations

4. **Talk to customers**

   | Question | What You Learn |
   |----------|----------------|
   | Why are you buying our product? | Value drivers |
   | Why are you NOT buying? | Blockers, gaps |
   | What do you like about us? | Strengths to amplify |
   | What problems do you have? | Unmet needs |
   | What market conditions are you facing? | External context |
   | How are you growing? | Their trajectory |

5. **Assess opportunities**
   - After conversations, gather the team
   - Where are the opportunities to place our bet?

## Step 3: Define Product Strategy

With company strategy clear and customer knowledge gathered, answer:

| Question | Output |
|----------|--------|
| **How are we today?** | Current state assessment |
| **How does it compare to where we want to go?** | Gap analysis |
| **What are the gaps we want to address?** | Priority problems |
| **Who will be using this product?** | Target users |
| **What problems is this product solving?** | Core value proposition |
| **What type of product do we want to be?** | Product identity |

## Checkpoint Questions

### Before Product Strategy Work

- [ ] Is the investment thesis clear?
- [ ] Are strategic intents documented?
- [ ] Do we have company-level answers (problem, differentiation, vision)?
- [ ] Have we talked to customers recently?
- [ ] Do we know where we're winning and losing?

### Product Strategy Readiness

- [ ] Can we articulate current state honestly?
- [ ] Is the gap to desired state clear?
- [ ] Are target users defined?
- [ ] Are problems prioritized?
- [ ] Do we know what type of product we want to be?

## Implications for This System

**For Strategy agent:**
- Start by checking company strategy clarity
- If company-level questions are unanswered, work there first
- Customer knowledge is prerequisite for product strategy

**For Discovery agent:**
- Customer interview questions from this flow
- Win/loss analysis as discovery input

**For Vision agent:**
- Investment thesis connects to vision
- Company vision should exist before product strategy

## Key Insight

> Product strategy is a **bridge** between company strategy and roadmap. If company strategy is unclear, product strategy becomes guesswork.
