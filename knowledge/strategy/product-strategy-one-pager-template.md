# Product Strategy One-Pager Template

**Source:** Personal template (Arnon)
**Use in:** Strategy, Roadmap, Alignment

## How Agents Should Use This Template

When a user asks for help creating a product strategy one-pager:

1. **Check context first** — Read company-profile and product-profile for existing context
2. **Work section by section** — Don't dump the whole template; guide through each section conversationally
3. **Ask before writing** — For each section, ask clarifying questions, then draft
4. **Challenge weak answers** — Push back on vague statements ("provide value") with specific alternatives
5. **Connect to Know Your Game** — If user can't articulate their game, pause and work on that first

**Conversation flow:**
```
1. "What problem are you solving?" → Draft The Problem
2. "Where do you want to be in 3-5 years?" → Draft Vision + Phases
3. "What game are you playing? How do you keep score?" → Draft Know Your Game
4. "Why will you win? Why now?" → Draft Strategic Narrative
5. "What advantages are you building?" → Draft How We Win
6. "What are your 3-5 big bets?" → Draft Strategic Pillars
7. "What could go wrong?" → Draft Risks
```

**Output:** Offer to compile into a single markdown document when complete.

## Purpose

A product strategy one-pager aligns the team on **where we're going** and **why we believe we'll win**. It's not a roadmap (what we're building) — it's the strategic context that makes roadmap decisions obvious.

**Audience:** Leadership, investors, cross-functional teams
**Update frequency:** Quarterly or when strategy shifts

## Template Structure

### Header

```
# Product Strategy
Owner: [Name]
Last Updated: [Date]
```

---

### 1. The Problem

> *Why does this matter? What pain exists?*

Write 2-3 sentences that make the problem feel urgent and real. Use concrete language, not abstractions.

**Example:**
> Property owners want higher income. Guests want frictionless stays. But owners are buried in manual tasks across 10+ tools. Guests arrive to disappointment. The system was never designed for scale — only patched together over decades.

**Tips:**
- Lead with customer pain, not your solution
- Make it visceral — the reader should feel the problem
- End with why the status quo is broken

---

### 2. Product Vision

> *Where are we going? What does success look like?*

One paragraph describing the end state (3-5 years), followed by a phased progression.

**Visual: Value over Time**

**Phases Table**

| Phase                  | Goal                      | Hypothesis                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **GET BIG** (0-1 year) | [Penetrate market with X] | [What we believe will drive adoption]   |
| **LEAD** (1-3 years)   | [Become the leader in Y]  | [What we believe will create dominance] |
| **EXPAND** (+3 years)  | [Extend into Z]           | [What we believe unlocks adjacencies]   |


**Tips:**
- Phases should be sequential — each enables the next
- Hypotheses make strategy testable, not just aspirational
- Be specific about what "winning" means at each phase
- The chart shows compounding value — each phase builds on the previous

---

### 3. Know Your Game

> *What game are we playing? How do we keep score?*

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **The Game** | [One sentence: What strategic game are we playing?] |
| **Primary Metric** | [The #1 metric that defines winning] |
| **Supporting Metrics** | [2-3 additional metrics we track] |

**Example games:**
- "We're playing the **automation game** — win by eliminating manual work"
- "We're playing the **platform game** — win by becoming infrastructure others build on"
- "We're playing the **trust game** — win by being the most reliable option"

**Tips:**
- If the team can't agree on the game, strategy is unclear
- Metrics should directly reflect the game you're playing
- When this is clear, prioritization becomes obvious

---

### 4. Strategic Narrative

> *Why now? Why us? Why will we win?*

| Element | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| **Market Reality** | [What's happening in the market that creates opportunity?] |
| **Our Hypothesis** | [What do we believe that others don't?] |
| **Urgency** | [Why must we act now? What's the window?] |
| **Conviction** | [Why will customers choose us over alternatives?] |

**Example:**
> **Market Reality:** 50,000+ European property managers run manually on outdated stacks, juggling 10+ tools.
>
> **Our Hypothesis:** AI agent technology has reached an inflection point where complex hospitality workflows can be automated at 85%+ accuracy.
>
> **Urgency:** The next 10-12 months represent a unique window before larger players recognize this shift.
>
> **Conviction:** Property managers will consolidate to AI-first platforms that deliver measurable ROI (3x FTE efficiency) rather than incrementally better tools.

**Tips:**
- Market Reality should be factual and verifiable
- Hypothesis should be contrarian — if everyone believes it, it's not differentiated
- Urgency creates focus — strategy without urgency becomes a wishlist
- Conviction should be testable with customer evidence

### 5. How We Win

> *What's our right to win? What moats are we building?*

| Advantage | How It Works | Defensibility |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| [Advantage 1] | [Mechanism] | [Why hard to copy] |
| [Advantage 2] | [Mechanism] | [Why hard to copy] |
| [Advantage 3] | [Mechanism] | [Why hard to copy] |

**Common moat types:**
- **Data network effects** — More data → better product → more users → more data
- **Workflow integration** — Embedded in daily work = hard to rip out
- **Switching costs** — Migration pain keeps customers locked in
- **Brand/Trust** — Reputation built over time
- **Technology** — Proprietary capability others can't replicate
- **Economies of scale** — Cost advantages at volume

**Tips:**
- Be honest about defensibility — "better product" alone isn't a moat
- At least one advantage should compound over time
- Connect advantages to strategic pillars

---

### 6. Strategic Pillars

> *What are our 3-5 big bets?*

| Pillar | What We're Building | Business Outcome |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **1. [Name]** | [Product/capability] | [Measurable outcome] |
| **2. [Name]** | [Product/capability] | [Measurable outcome] |
| **3. [Name]** | [Product/capability] | [Measurable outcome] |
| **4. [Name]** | [Product/capability] | [Measurable outcome] |

**Example:**
| Pillar | What We're Building | Business Outcome |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Single Source of Truth** | All data connected across tools | 99% data accuracy for AI decisions |
| **Agentic AI Orchestration** | AI agents handling ops tasks | 3x units per FTE, 70% automation |
| **Stakeholder Apps** | Owner + Guest + Service apps | 100% net retention |

**Tips:**
- 3-5 pillars maximum — more than 5 means lack of focus
- Each pillar should connect to How We Win
- Business outcomes should be measurable, not vague
- Pillars are strategic themes, not features

---

### 7. Risks & Mitigation

> *What could go wrong? How do we protect against it?*

| Risk Category | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------------|------|--------|------------|
| [Category] | [What could happen] | [Consequence] | [How we address it] |
| [Category] | [What could happen] | [Consequence] | [How we address it] |

**Common risk categories:**
- Competitive (others catch up)
- Technical (can't build what we promised)
- Market (demand doesn't materialize)
- Regulatory (rules change)
- Execution (team can't deliver)
- Adoption (customers won't switch)

**Tips:**
- Be honest — sugar-coating risks doesn't help
- Mitigation should be actionable, not "we'll figure it out"
- Prioritize risks by likelihood × impact
