## Core Definition

Strategy is a **set of choices** about your product.

**Key principle:** Strategic choices should not be easy. They should feel hard and come at a cost. Choosing to do or be something inherently means choosing NOT to do or be something else.

**Influenced by:**
- Roger Martin (*Playing to Win*) - Strategy as choices
- Richard Rumelt (*Good Strategy Bad Strategy*) - Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, Coherent Actions

## What Makes a Good Strategy: The 5 Ingredients

### 1. Boundaries
A strategy must be confined by three dimensions:

**Breadth:** Defines the area the strategy covers
- One product, part of a product, group of products, or full portfolio
- Product strategy is narrower than business strategy, broader than GTM strategy

**Depth (Detail):** How much information to include
- Shallow depth creates freedom and autonomy in execution
- Greater depth (less flexibility) when economy is weak or cost-consciousness is high

**Time:** Defined time horizon
- Examples: 1 quarter, 1 year, 3 years
- Can have multiple layers (e.g., multi-year strategy supported by quarterly strategies)

### 2. Aligned
Product strategy exists within a "constellation" of organizational forces.

**Must align with:**
- Business strategy
- Marketing strategy
- Tech strategy
- Sales strategy

**Gravitational pull:** Different strategies exert forces on each other until equilibrium is found.

**Example:** If company has significant tech debt, Tech Strategy will heavily constrain product strategy because certain things cannot be built until debt is addressed.

### 3. Informed
Great strategies are backed by data and discovery, not guesses.

**Requires:**
- Strategic discovery to identify what competitors are NOT doing
- Data-backed decisions
- Understanding what's being missed in the market

### 4. Measurable and Iterative
**Measurability:** Success must be measurable. OKRs are a "model" of the strategy, turning strategic choices into measurable levers.

**Cadence:** Set heartbeat for review (commonly quarterly) to reflect, pause, and adjust.

**Emergent Strategy:** Because strategies rely on assumptions, parts will only emerge during execution.

**Example of knock-on effects:** Choosing to target Southeast Asia (Who) impacts What. Because many use smartphones over computers with inconsistent Wi-Fi, strategy must become mobile-first with offline feasibility.

### 5. Detailed and Actionable
Avoid fluffy statements like "we want to be best-in-class."

**The litmus test:** A great strategy explains:
- WHAT choices were made
- WHY they were made
- HOW you came to those decisions

**Example:** "Because the business has a 35% churn problem, the product team will stop working on acquisition features for the next quarter to focus entirely on resolving the top reasons for customer churn."

## How to Build Strategy: The 4-Step Process

### Step 1: Inputs and Data Gathering
Start external and work inward.

**Three categories:**
1. **Market Data (External)**
   - Industry trends
   - Competitive landscape
   - User segmentation
   - Jobs to be done

2. **Business Data (The Ecosystem)**
   - Company vision and goals
   - Existing strategy
   - Performance metrics
   - SWOT analysis

3. **Product Data (Internal)**
   - Current state and performance

**Tools:**
- PESTEL Analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental)
- Porter's Five Forces
- Competitive mapping
- Perceptual mapping

**Example (Tesla c. 2006):**
- Industry trends: High investment in sustainability, clean energy growth
- Data points: Current carbon emissions from vehicles
- Social/legal factors: Increasing environmental awareness, tighter regulations

### Step 2: Synthesis and Building Narratives
Separate "signals" from "noise" in the data.

**Strategic Narrative = Data + Belief**
- Past data (what is known to be true)
- Future belief (what we believe will be true)

**Problem solving vs Strategy:**
- Fixing retention because data shows a leaking bucket = problem solving
- Strategy = "We believe if we don't fix retention, customers will leave, write one-star reviews, and we will run out of business"

**Tesla narrative example:**
"The market is growing exponentially (Data). We expect this to increase as laws change (Belief). Transport emits high CO2 (Data). With battery tech leaps, we believe EVs are now viable as a business model (Belief)."

**Purpose:** Narratives communicate the "why" to stakeholders and justify why certain ideas are rejected.

### Step 3: Modeling and Strategic Choices
Brainstorm actions based on narratives. Evaluate pros and cons.

**Roger Martin's "Opposite of Stupid" Test:**
If the opposite of your strategic choice is "stupid," it's not a strategic choice.

**Bad example:** "We want the best customer experience" - opposite is stupid, not a choice
**Good example:** "Start at top of market (Tesla)" - opposite (start with mass market) is not stupid, just a different choice with different trade-offs

**Consider constraints:**
Strategic choices must be realistic given resources, funding, capabilities.

**Example:** A self-funded startup had "hire top talent" as a strategic pillar, but couldn't afford senior people. Not viable.

### Step 4: Packaging and Communication
Package choices into a cohesive document.

**Include:**
- Title and description
- Target audience
- The "why" (supported by narratives)
- How to achieve it
- How to measure progress

## Strategic Tools and Concepts

### Defining the Niche
Template: **Market/Industry → Personal Persona → Unique Traits → Action/Goal → Specific Need/Problem**

**Fintech example:** Global companies (Market) with financial controllers (Persona) managing multiple bank accounts/currencies (Traits) who need a single view of their financial position (Need) because they lack automated global cash view (Problem).

**Amazon (start):** For readers with computer and internet (90s) who regularly purchase books and want wide, convenient catalog.

**Lululemon (start):** Active women who participate in yoga and find it difficult to find clothes that fit their silhouettes.

**Expansion path:** Starting narrow allows clear expansion roadmap. Lululemon: women's yoga → men's yoga → running gear → casual clothes.

### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
Formula: "We help [someone] do [something] by [doing something unique]"

**Loom example:** For professionals who want fewer meetings; solved by allowing users to record and share videos instead.

### Building a Moat
Four types of competitive advantage:

1. **Network Effects:** Product becomes more valuable as more people use it
   - Tesla (cars learn from each other, charging network)
   - YouTube (more creators → better content → more viewers)

2. **Switching Costs:** Product so embedded it's expensive/difficult to leave
   - Apple (iPod/iTunes ecosystem)
   - Sonos (speakers only connect within ecosystem)

3. **Economies of Scale:** Cost per unit decreases as company grows
   - Amazon, Walmart

4. **Intangible Assets:** Patents, trademarks, brand value
   - Ferrari (brand status)
   - Netflix (exclusive content)

### Positioning vs. Differentiation
**Differentiation:** Tangible, physical differences (features)
**Positioning:** Perceptual - how people think about the product

**Example:** Bugatti Chiron costs $3M but has no cup holders. People don't refuse to buy based on missing features (differentiation); they buy for luxury perception (positioning).

**Coherence:** Physical differentiation should support positioning. Bank of Australia positions as "responsible banking" and supports this by being first carbon-neutral bank.

## Practical Guidance

### Communication and Buy-In
- Don't create strategy in a vacuum
- Involve stakeholders during creation process
- Use "strategy on a page" for high-level communication
- Keep detailed document for those who want depth

### Linking Work to Strategy
Always explain the "why" chain:
"We are building Feature X to solve Problem Y, which helps us reach OKR Z, which supports Strategic Choice A"

### Roadmaps
- Near-term items: concrete features
- Long-term items: opportunities or future bets
- Progression should reflect strategy

### Measuring Impact
Measure the impact of every significant output. Without measuring individual features, one success might hide two failures detracting from goals.

### Starting from Scratch
If no clear strategy exists, start with **Value Exchange:**
- What value does the product provide?
- To whom?
- What do they give in return?

### Innovation as Strategic Choice
Innovation timing depends on lifecycle stage:
- Growth stage: optimize for scale
- Mature stage: must innovate to avoid decline (e.g., Blockbuster)

### Avoiding Tunnel Vision
Being niche is good for starting point, but being too narrow in breadth can cause tunnel vision and missing critical periphery elements or market shifts.

### Ownership and Collaboration
- Conviction should come from the person who owns and executes the strategy
- Start with small "Product Trio" (Product, Design, Tech)
- Expand to squad and senior leaders for buy-in

### Metrics and Data
- Use past data to model future
- If data is missing: time-box research, use public reports (McKinsey), or make documented assumptions
- Cannot perfectly predict future, but model based on available evidence

### Quantity of Choices
Less is more:
- Startup: 2-3 choices
- Large enterprise: Half a dozen maximum
- Strategy must create focus and help say "no"

## Context-Specific Guidance

**Public Sector/Government:**
Market competition less relevant. Focus on market trends regarding user behavior, social norms, and perceptions.

**Highly Regulated Markets (Fintech):**
Use PESTEL analysis

**Highly Competitive Markets:**
Use Porter's Five Forces or Blue Ocean strategy

## Key Quotes

"Strategy is about choosing to do or be something, which inherently means choosing NOT to do or be something else."

"Strategic choices should not be easy; they should feel hard and come at a physical or metaphorical cost."

"Simply filling in boxes does not result in a strategy; it requires deep thinking, collaboration, and research."

"If the opposite of your strategic choice is 'stupid,' it is not a strategic choice."

## So What?

1. Strategy is choices - hard choices that come at a cost
2. Good strategy has 5 ingredients: Boundaries, Aligned, Informed, Measurable, Detailed
3. Build strategy in 4 steps: Inputs → Synthesis → Modeling → Packaging
4. Strategic narrative combines past data with future beliefs
5. Test choices with "opposite of stupid" - if opposite is obviously bad, it's not a strategic choice
6. Start narrow (niche), expand later
7. Build moats through network effects, switching costs, economies of scale, or intangible assets
8. Strategy without conviction is just goal-setting
