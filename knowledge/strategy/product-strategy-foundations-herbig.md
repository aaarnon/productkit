## Overview

This guide covers essential practices for Product Teams to own and shape their Product Strategy to guide roadmaps, OKRs, and Discovery. It helps teams move from "we build whatever users ask for" to taking evidence-informed stands on strategic choices.

## Chapter 1: A Practical Primer on Product Strategy

### Strategy Patterns vs Templates

**Key insight:** "Good" and "bad" strategy is misleading. Focus instead on **patterns** that make Product Strategy more useful in specific environments.

| Strategy Templates | Strategy Patterns |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Prescribed and Rigid | Flexible |
| Finite (feels "done" after workshop) | Iterative (continuous process) |
| Linear (step-by-step) | Non-linear (elements interact) |

**Signs your strategy is useful:**
- Clear reasoning behind rejected feature ideas
- Teams can set and adapt Discovery priorities using it
- Colleagues can talk about strategic priorities without checking notes

### The Three Product Strategy Patterns

Based on Roger Martin's definition: *"Strategy is an integrated set of choices that positions you on a playing field based on vision and goals in a way that you win."*

| Pattern | Description | Components |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Strategic Narrative** | Why you're targeting a specific market opportunity | Vision, mid-to-long-term goals |
| **Playing Field** | The market itself, including choices and competition | User/buyer segments, relevant jobs, alternatives |
| **Winning Moves** | Choices needed to position your product to best advantage | Offerings, value propositions, channels, differentiators |

**Self-check questions:**
1. Do we have a Strategic Narrative? What's missing?
2. How clear is our Playing Field? What's missing?
3. Do we know our Winning Moves beyond a feature list? What's missing?

### Aligning Strategy Across Levels

| Level | Description | Scope |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Company Strategy** | Where the company wants to go | Entering new markets, abandoning business models |
| **Product Strategy** | Overarching guidance for tactical design and execution | Playing field for the product |
| **Feature Strategy** | Winning on the playing field through differentiation | Individual problems solved |

**Note:** In early-stage companies, Company Strategy IS the Product Strategy.

### The Stable Core vs Dynamic Peripherals

**Stable Core** (don't revise quarterly):
- Vision
- Mid-to-long-term goals
- User/buyer segments
- Differentiators

**Dynamic Peripherals** (adjust with OKR cycles):
- Jobs of chosen segment
- Distribution channels
- Offerings/value propositions

### Transforming Messy Insights into Clear Strategy

**Invert the typical approach:**

Most teams start with templates (wrong) → Should end with templates

```
Deep Dive Activities (start here)
    ↓
Template Synthesis
    ↓
Statement (end here)
```

**Key insight:** You cannot design an evidence-based Product Strategy in one workshop session.

## Product Vision vs Product Strategy

| Product Vision | Product Strategy |
|----------------|------------------|
| Describes an **aspirational future** | Outlines a **set of choices** |
| Focuses on **changes for users** | Provides a **holistic perspective** |
| Enables **ambitious strategy** | Relies on **forward-looking vision** |
| Defines **where you are going** | Defines **how you will get there** |

> "The main difference is that Product Vision describes the future state for your users, which emerges from the value provided by your product, while Product Strategy is about the set of choices you need to achieve your Product Vision."

### Bidirectional Flow

> "The relationships between ambitions and tactics must flow in both directions: just as Product Strategy and Vision must trickle down, insights and learnings from Discovery and Delivery must also trickle up."

### The Product Domains Flow

```
Product Vision → Product Strategy → Product Goals → Product Discovery → Product Delivery
      ↑_________________________________↓
           (insights flow back up)
```

### Vision Drives Strategy Scale

| Low-Key Vision | Low-Key Strategy |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Help current users send more emails through cleaner design" | Focus on current user problems, differentiate through aesthetics, current team skills sufficient |

| Ambitious Vision | Ambitious Strategy |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Blue-collar professionals communicate without barriers to redistribute wealth" | Gradual unlocking of sub-segments, multiple offerings, rethink team skills and moats |

## Chapter 2: Putting Product Strategy into Action

### Product Strategy Choices: The Explicitness Test

Roger Martin's test:
> "My test for whether a stated choice is actually a strategic choice is whether or not the opposite of the choice is stupid on its face."

**Problem with generic statements:**
- "Make the product better" → Too many options, no guidance
- "Increase revenue" → Doesn't help teams say no

**Example of explicit choice:**
"Grow SaaS product through agency clients as strong multipliers"
- Changes which alternatives you compare against
- Requires new product differentiators for new buyer personas
- Requires additional features for agency use cases

### Implicit vs Explicit Choices

| Implicit ("Increase Revenue") | Explicit ("Growing recurring revenues through agency clients") |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| On-strategy segments: Fortune 500, SMBs, Solo freelancers, ... | On-strategy: Analytics Agency Employees (>1M ARR), Clients of Analytics Agencies |
| Off-strategy: No one? | Off-strategy: Fortune 500, Solo Freelancers |
| Result: Opportunistic discovery, opinion-based decisions | Result: Clear research intent, knows who to test with, how to measure success |

### The Four Pillars of Product Strategy

| Pillar | Components |
|--------|------------|
| **IDEA** | Product Vision and End Goals, Defendable moats against alternatives, Key drivers pushing product forward |
| **VALUE** | User segments worth building for, Important motivations for user segments, Key problems preventing success |
| **CAPABILITIES** | Features and services addressing key problems, Required resources and structures, Pre-requisites for execution |
| **MARKET** | Direct and indirect alternatives, Customers and buyer personas, Distribution channels |

### Executing Through OKRs

**Key distinction:**

| Reactive KPIs | Proactive Key Results |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Overall indicators of business/product health | Derived from strategic priorities or user problems |
| Monitored continuously on the side without time | Explicitly chosen as focus during specific period |
| Like car fuel: care only when it dips | Like highway share of a long car ride |

**Example: Translating Strategy Choices to Key Results**

| Strategic Choice | Proxy Key Results |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Grow through agency clients as strong multipliers | €200,000 opportunity value from agency prospects in pipeline; 12 client projects created on platform |
| Scale client growth through onboarding automation | Reduce onboarding time by support by 40%; Increase customers onboarded by 30% |

## The Product Strategy-Metrics Sandwich

### The Three Layers

| Layer | Description | Time Horizon |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **North Star Metric** | Measures persistent experienced value, relates to Product Vision | Continuous |
| **Product Strategy** | Expresses most promising choices informed by evidence | 6-18 months |
| **Objectives & Key Results** | Point-in-time progress through holistic metrics | Quarterly |

### NSMs vs OKRs: Key Questions

| Question | If Yes = OKR | If Yes = NSM |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Is there a specific timeline attached? | ✓ | |
| Does it require more than one team to move? | | ✓ |
| Is it directly linked to long-term Vision? | | ✓ |
| Is it linked to specific strategy choice? | ✓ | |

### The NSM is the Quantified Sibling of Product Vision

**Example: Digital Fitness Company**

| Level | Vision | NSM |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Company** | "Parents can get closer to the best version of themselves on their own time. Anytime and anywhere." | No. of Weeks Spent in Fulfilling Shape |
| **Personal Strength Product** | "You don't need a gym to be held accountable for individualized workouts" | Share of completed 6-week cycles with achieved strength goal |
| **Mental Fitness Product** | "Feel confident about getting back into desired shape without worrying about overloading" | No. of anxious users performing the sport they felt "blocked" to do |

### Turning Lagging Proxies into Leading Indicators

**Reverse-engineer from successful users:**

```
Lagging Indicator: "No. of inexperienced users meditating 3-times for 6 weeks in a row"

Leading Indicators (trading certainty for responsiveness):
- Visiting detail page of meditation (frequent but no correlation)
- Completing 2nd meditation in 1st week (80% correlation!)
- Meditating 3rd week in a row
```

### Complete Sandwich Example

| Layer | Mental Fitness Product |
|-------|----------------------|
| **North Star Metric** | No. of anxious users performing the sport/action they felt "blocked" to do |
| **Product Strategy** | Guide mental unblocking through content from athletes and experienced coaches |
| **Key Results** | X% completed 2nd meditation series in 1st week; X content relevancy score |

## Chapter 3: Product Strategy Deep Dives

### B2B vs B2C Product Strategy

#### Similarities

**1. Both must consider the other's behaviors**
- B2C products often need B2B enablers (e.g., heycar needs car dealers to supply inventory)
- B2B products have users who behave like consumers (champions = early adopters)

**2. Strategy emerges from patterns, not templates**
> "None of these frameworks really work properly. It's always a combination of 10,000 different things. You need to summarize and synthesize and understand and challenge and bring together a concept." — Stephanie Leue, CPO Doodle

**3. Clear strategy requires collaboration (The IKEA Effect)**
Strategy should emerge from both top-down AND bottom-up. When people build it together, they support it.

**MAC Cycle of Strategy Creation:**
1. **Mining** — for insights to form foundation
2. **Assembling** — individual insights into cohesive structure
3. **Communicating** — synthesized statements for guidance

#### Differences

**1. Audience inputs diverge**

| B2B | B2C |
|-----|-----|
| Close qualitative interactions with users/champions/customers | Distant users (only reach via email, app reviews) |
| Voice "screams in your ear" | Voice is "very far away" |
| Easy to hear but may skew toward power users | Hard to quantify, need aggregation (NPS-like scores) |

**2. Strategy choices carry different risks**

| B2B | B2C |
|-----|-----|
| Longer sales cycles | Faster testing and piloting |
| Higher commitment per decision | Easier course correction |
| Changing course requires organizational restructuring | Changing personas is relatively simple |
| Evaluation takes longer | Lower risk timelines |

**3. B2C can expand to B2B (but not vice versa)**
- Doodle: Started B2C, added B2B subscriptions
- Blinkist: Started B2C, added Blinkist Business
- **Why it works:** Every consumer is part of a business with "B2C-ized" behaviors
- **Counter-example (Slack):** Deliberately said NO to B2C community market, left space for Discord

### How to Define an Ambitious Product Vision

#### The Four Drivers of Product Vision

| Internal Drivers | External Drivers |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Purpose | Market Dynamics |
| Values | User Insights |

#### Workshop Approach: Future-State Empathy Map

| Section | Questions for Future State |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **WHO** | Concise description of target audience; Focus on differentiating attributes |
| **PAINS** | What are their fears, frustrations, anxieties? |
| **GAINS** | What are their wants, needs, hopes, dreams? |
| **SEEING** | What do they see in marketplace? In their environment? What do they see others doing? |
| **NEED TO DO** | What do they need to do differently? What decisions must they make? How will we know they succeeded? |

**Key benefit:** Empathy Map keeps conversation away from features—it's all about user experience, desired value, and activities.

#### Synthesis Approach

1. Lay out all Empathy Map categories
2. Give team members dots for voting
3. Frame voting for ambition: "Which ideas make you most uncomfortable?" or "Which feel almost unattainable?"
4. Use word clouds to surface trends
5. Draft statement answering:
   - Who are your intended users?
   - How will they behave/feel/look in the future vs today?
   - How will your product create this difference?

#### Testing Your Vision

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 5-second test | Present vision, capture ad-hoc associations |
| Comfort-level survey | Have people rate on comfort scale |
| All-hands sharing | Ask if they would come on board to work toward it |

**Test for ambition and comfort-level, not general approval.**
