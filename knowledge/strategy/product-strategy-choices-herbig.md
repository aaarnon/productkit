## Core Insight

Effective Product Strategy is about articulating **explicit choices** and making sure they get translated into action. Generic strategy statements fail because they don't narrow options.

---

## The Problem with Generic Strategy

| Generic Statement | Problem |
|-------------------|---------|
| "Make the product better" | Too many options - not actionable |
| "Focus on growth" | Doesn't guide prioritization |
| "Improve user experience" | Lacks specificity for teams |

Generic statements fail the intent of Product Strategy - they don't help teams say NO to things.

---

## Explicit vs Implicit Choices

| Explicit Choices | Implicit Choices |
|------------------|------------------|
| Narrow team's options | Leave everything open |
| Enable saying NO to segments | Can't decline opportunities |
| Guide discovery and delivery | Teams guess what matters |
| Measurable progress | Vague progress |

**Key insight:** Explicit Product Strategy Choices help teams focus and prioritize their Product Discovery efforts. Implicit choices don't allow teams to say no.

## What Makes a Choice Explicit?

An explicit choice:
- Names a specific direction (not "improve" but "scale through automation")
- Implies what you're NOT doing
- Can be translated into measurable outcomes
- Guides daily prioritization decisions

**Example of explicit choice:**
> "Scale client growth through onboarding automation"

This tells the team:
- Focus area: onboarding
- Approach: automation (not manual, not hiring)
- Goal: scale (not just maintain)

---

## Translating Choices into OKRs

One of the most effective ways to execute Product Strategy choices is to translate each choice into proxy metrics and use them as goals.

**Example:**

| Strategic Choice | Key Results |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "Scale client growth through onboarding automation" | Reduce onboarding time spent by support by 40% |
| | Increase customers onboarded by 30% |

## The Strategy-Metrics Connection

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           North Star Metric             │
│         (Long-term value proxy)         │
└───────────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Product Strategy Choices        │
│        (Explicit priorities)            │
└───────────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               OKRs                      │
│    (Quantified success per choice)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why OKRs feel random:** When they're not connected to clear Product Strategy Choices.

## OKRs as Strategy in a Nutshell

OKRs for product teams should:
- Connect short/mid-term priorities to the overarching WHY
- Take specific choices and quantify what success looks like
- Help teams prioritize day-to-day activities
- Express a holistic view of success through quantifiable metrics

---

## Course Correction

Use your OKR cycles to:
1. Check progress on explicit Product Strategy choices
2. Course-correct when necessary
3. Validate if choices are still the right ones
4. Adjust metrics if strategy evolves

---

## Self-Check Questions

1. Can your team articulate your top 3 strategic choices?
2. Do those choices help you say NO to things?
3. Are your OKRs directly tied to strategic choices?
4. Would a new team member understand what NOT to work on?

---

## So What?

1. Audit your current strategy statements - are they explicit or generic?
2. Rewrite generic statements as explicit choices
3. For each choice, define what success looks like (metrics)
4. Translate into OKRs
5. Use OKR cadence to check if choices are working
