## The Problem: One Approach Creates Many Problems

All product work is not equal. Common symptoms of not understanding this:

- Lots of V0, low scoped, incomplete experiences in the product
- Difficulty getting PMs to do "non-sexy" but important product work
- A focus on shipping new features over success
- Team moving slowly because product surface area is too large
- Success of all product efforts measured by a single metric (i.e. NPS)
- Work bogged down in technical debt or constantly fighting fires
- MVP terminology used as excuse to cut time and scope
- Team uses technology because it's cool, not relevant (Blockchain, ML, AR/VR)

**The real problem:** There are different kinds of product work, each with their own processes, measures of success, and strategies.

## The Four Types of Product Work

After initial product-market fit, there are four categories of product problems:

```

│   ┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐              │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Feature Work** | Creating and capturing value by extending a product's functionality and market into incremental and adjacent areas |
| **Growth Work** | Creating and capturing value by accelerating adoption and usage by the existing market |
| **Scaling Work** | Focusing on bottlenecks to ensure the team can continue to move forward and take on new levels of feature, growth, and PMF expansion work |
| **PMF Expansion** | Increasing the ceiling on product-market fit in a non-incremental way by expanding into an adjacent market, adjacent product, or both |

## Wrong Process, Wrong Success Metric, Wrong Strategy

> "One of the most common conflicts I've seen is when product leaders try to apply a single development process, measure of success, and strategy to all product work." — Fareed Mosavat

### Wrong Process

- Most PMs are unaware of different types of product work
- PMs believe what worked before will work again
- As orgs grow, variance and complexity of work types grows

### Wrong Measure of Success

- Each type needs different measures
- Wrong measures create wrong incentives
- PMs think career progress requires constantly building new features OR generating near-term revenue OR working on long-term strategy

> "Companies tend to reinforce the problem of focusing on feature work at the expense of other important product work. It's exciting to talk about new features, and they shine the limelight on the PMs doing that work." — Ravi Mehta

### Wrong Strategy

Common mistakes:

| Mistake | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| **Growth when should do Feature** | Product is being optimized prematurely |
| **Feature when should do Growth** | Over-expanding product surface area vs getting existing product to more people |
| **Growth/Feature when should do PMF Expansion** | Can't grow faster if you've saturated current PMF |
| **Growth/Feature when should do Scaling** | Delaying tech work until it becomes difficult to launch new things |
| **No cohesive sequence** | One type of work done in wrong order of operations |

> "My first year at Pinterest we built a Maps product and a Q&A product, neither of which had any material impact to the business and were later deleted. In year two, we changed the 'Pin It' button to say 'Save' and got a 15% increase in activation rate just from that." — Casey Winters

## Feature Work

### Every Feature Casts A Shadow

**Shipping features is not the job.** Once shipped, there are always follow-on costs:

| Shadow Cost | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Maintenance Costs** | No such thing as zero maintenance. Features must be constantly maintained, evolved, supported |
| **User Costs** | Every feature creates cognitive complexity. Impacts feature discovery, onboarding, etc. |
| **Killing Costs** | "We can always kill it" is far harder said than done. Costs in customer satisfaction and resources to deprecate |

> "At Pinterest, we were getting feedback that new users had a hard time understanding the product. Users were confused: should they be Pinning or Liking? We tested removing Likes—it didn't impact retention at all. So we sunset that feature." — Casey Winters

> "At one point we tried killing the '/me' feature in Slack. It created a ton of backlash and we ended up undoing the decision. There are no dark corners of your product that are easy to kill." — Fareed Mosavat

### The Feature Shadow Creates Issues When Ignored

1. **Distractions and Thrashing** — Team thrashes between initiatives as follow-on work pulls from strategic initiatives
2. **Product Complexity** — Complicates engineering. Can lead to disruption
3. **Friction for Users** — Harder for new users to adopt and use

> "Left unchecked, product complexity leads to disruption. The history of tech is littered with companies that got disrupted by more streamlined products (Yahoo → Google, MySpace → Facebook, SharePoint → Slack, Match → Tinder)." — Ravi Mehta

### Features Should Tell A Cohesive Story

When Apple launched Touch ID, it seemed weird. But they sequenced Touch ID, Wallet, and NFC-enabled phones → Apple Pay (the real story).

**Done well, features sequence where 1+1 = 3.**

> "When people say a product was 'ahead of its time,' what they really mean is that the product didn't do enough to lead people through the behavioral change necessary to get value from the product." — Ravi Mehta

---

## Growth Work

Before building a feature, ask: **"How are users going to find out about and build a habit around this feature?"**

### Common Misbeliefs

**Misbelief 1: Growth Is Someone Else's Job**
- "We build the product, getting users is marketing/sales job"
- Growth is driven by: Retention, Acquisition, Monetization
- Product sits at the center of this system

**Misbelief 2: Growth = More Features**
- A new feature could be the answer, but often isn't
- Most product teams know how to develop features but don't understand other growth levers

**Misbelief 3: Growth = Ruthless Optimization**
- Leads to local maximums, dark patterns, bad experimentation
- Many methods to address growth constraints beyond optimization

### Growth Work Begins With Understanding Your Growth Model

"Everything drives growth" is a deflection from not knowing the difference between direct and indirect impact.

**You need to answer:** How does your product grow?

Then: identify largest constraint → determine constraint type → choose method → experiment to validate

---

## Scaling Work

As product accelerates growth, new bottlenecks slow shipping. Scaling ensures the team maintains ability to ship across feature, growth, and PMF expansion work.

### No Recognition When You Do, Bad Recognition When You Don't

- Scaling work isn't sexy or visible
- You don't get recognized for doing it
- But when you don't do it, you get recognized very negatively

> "One small way Facebook rewards scaling work is by featuring a 'Fix of the Week.' Every week, Mark invites someone to discuss an important fix at all-hands, giving the company an opportunity to celebrate critical work that often goes under-appreciated." — Ravi Mehta

**Zoom example:** CFO quoted in 2018 on keeping extra 50% capacity available at all times. Enabled them to scale during COVID when demand could have gone to Google.

### Three Categories of Scaling Work

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Technical Scaling** | Handle higher volume. Infrastructure, managing eng debt, design debt |
| **Process Scaling** | Overcome internal challenges. Org complexity, multiple teams coordinating |
| **User Scaling** | Overcome external challenges. Fraud detection, spam filtering, security |

### Timing: Not Too Late, Not Too Early

The Goldilocks rule:
- Too late = roadblock to opportunities
- Too early = wasted resources that could be better spent elsewhere

**Questions to ask:**
1. How much of your work is unplanned? Putting out fires?
2. What opportunities aren't you doing because they're too hard to implement?
3. Which priorities didn't get done on time because of engineering debt?
4. Where does the team need more leverage on its time?

> "Scott Tong, our Head of Design at Pinterest, used to say 'design the right thing, then design it right.' Once we verified we built the right thing, we'd talk about tech and design debt we created to verify that. It's almost a zero tolerance policy for new tech and design debt." — Casey Winters

## Product Market Fit Expansion

Growth slows as product hits saturation. To continue fueling growth, PMF needs to expand non-incrementally.

### PMF Is Not Static

PMF is often misinterpreted as a static moment. Reality:
- Customer base is always changing
- Consumer expectations are always growing
- Once you get initial PMF, you have to keep it AND expand it

**The PMF Treadmill:**
- The better your initial PMF, the faster you grow
- The faster you grow, the faster customer expectations rise
- The slope of the PMF threshold line increases

> "Slack had extremely strong PMF from early days and ended up growing so fast. It was extremely difficult to keep up with rising expectations, and took us a while to launch things like WYSIWYG editing, better ways to launch apps, and simplified channel discovery that were important for newer, less-technical users." — Fareed Mosavat

### Three Ways to Expand PMF

| Strategy | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Adjacent Market** | Same product, new market segments | Slack → Slack Enterprise; International expansion; Instacart → pharmacy delivery |
| **Adjacent Product** | Same market, new products | HubSpot: Marketing → Sales → Customer Support; Credit Karma → Credit Karma Tax; Stripe → Atlas |
| **Diversification** | New product AND new market | Uber → Uber Freight/Eats; Amazon → AWS; Roman: men's → women's health |

### Creating New While Leveraging The Old

Most important question: **Why us?**

You must find unique value your company has to leverage. Not about building best product possible—about building best product while leveraging what makes you uniquely positioned.

> "At HubSpot, one of my key early mistakes was pushing the new Sales product toward prosumers. I was ignoring our key strategic advantage: distribution and brand among mid-market companies. We course corrected and the product is successful today, but I learned this the hard way." — Brian Balfour

> "At Runkeeper we released Breeze—beautiful new design, new name, great launch, great press, featured in App Store, decent retention. But it was never a breakout hit. The idea made sense for a new startup, but didn't meaningfully leverage any existing asset (tech, brand, existing product). Ultimately it was shut down." — Fareed Mosavat

### More Resources ≠ Easier PMF Expansion

**Over Resourcing:**
- Finding PMF requires tight loop: Target market hypothesis → Product hypothesis → Validate → Learn and iterate
- More people = more coordination, communication, overhead = slower loop
- Start small, add incrementally as things become clear

> "When we started developing new products at HubSpot, we started with 6 people separate from core teams. This allowed fast iteration. As we proved things out, we slowly added to team and rolled new products back into core functions." — Brian Balfour

**Over Distributing:**
- Throwing distribution muscle behind new products too early
- Finding PMF requires starting with narrow audience hypothesis
- Dumping huge audience creates noise, confusing feedback, slows the process

## The Goal: Breadth, Not Expertise in All

From "Crossing the Canyon: From PM to Product Leader":

Your job is not to build expertise in all areas (would take a lifetime). Your job is:
- Gain skills, toolkit, mental models, language
- Diagnose problems
- Communicate with clarity
- Provide course corrections

> "The best feedback I received: someone asked how I could walk in a room with 30% of context and identify what's wrong and help course correct. But this is the essence of the Product Lead role." — Bangaly Kaba

## Summary

| Type | Focus | Key Insight |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Feature Work** | Extend functionality | Every feature casts a shadow—account for follow-on costs |
| **Growth Work** | Accelerate adoption | Understand your growth model first |
| **Scaling Work** | Remove bottlenecks | Enables all other work; time it right |
| **PMF Expansion** | Expand market/product | Ask "Why us?" and leverage existing assets |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Different work needs different approaches** — Process, metrics, and strategy vary by type
2. **Sequence matters** — One type in wrong order causes problems
3. **Shadow costs are real** — Features have maintenance, user, and killing costs
4. **Scaling enables everything** — Don't neglect it; don't do it too early
5. **PMF is a treadmill** — Must continuously expand, not just maintain
6. **Leverage your assets** — PMF expansion must answer "Why us?"
7. **More resources ≠ faster PMF** — Small teams iterate faster
