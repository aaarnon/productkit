## Core Insight

> "Without a price, you don't have a product."

Determine pricing **before** designing products, not after. This forces alignment around customer value and prevents costly failures. About 80% of companies skip this and wait until launch - then struggle.

## Three Key Pricing Rules

### 1. Have the Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) Talk Early

Ask customers three specific questions about your innovation:

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| "What's an acceptable price?" | Floor - minimum they expect to pay |
| "What's an expensive price?" | Ceiling - where they start to hesitate |
| "What's prohibitively expensive?" | Walk-away point |

These create three data points revealing:
- Price elasticity
- Psychological thresholds
- Value perception

**Do this during discovery, not after launch.**

### 2. Investigate How You Charge, Not Just What

The payment **model** matters as much as the price point.

**Michelin example:** Instead of charging per tire, they shifted to mileage-based pricing. Result: 20% more revenue while delivering better customer value.

**Model considerations:**

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Predictability | Can customers forecast their costs? |
| Transparency | Do they understand what they're paying for? |
| Acceptance | Will they accept this model? |
| Scalability | Can we operationalize this? |
| Differentiation | Does it set us apart from competitors? |

**Pricing model options:**
- Per seat / per user
- Usage-based
- Outcome-based
- Flat subscription
- Tiered
- Freemium
- Hybrid

### 3. Segment Customers by Needs and WTP

Avoid one-size-fits-all products. Create different versions for distinct customer segments.

**Segmentation principles:**
- Start with 3-4 segments, expand gradually
- Use **observable criteria** for targeting
- Validate with sales teams
- Apply market sizing to ensure profitability

**Example tiers:**
| Tier | Target | Value Focus |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Starter | SMB, price-sensitive | Core functionality |
| Pro | Mid-market | Advanced features, integrations |
| Enterprise | Large orgs | Custom, security, support |

## Four Monetization Failures

| Problem | What It Is | Signs | Solution |
|---------|------------|-------|----------|
| **Feature Shock** | Over-engineered products with unclear value | Too many features, confused customers, low adoption | Bundle features into targeted packages |
| **Minivations** | Underpriced products leaving revenue on table | Too-fast sales cycles, no pushback on price | Monitor team ambition, test higher prices |
| **Hidden Gems** | Innovative products killed by middle management | Good ideas die in committee | Foster open culture, protect innovation |
| **Undead** | Products answering questions nobody asks | No WTP, but kept alive anyway | Validate WTP and market size **before** development |

## The Porsche vs Fiat Lesson

| Company | Approach | Result |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Porsche Cayenne** | Designed around what customers valued at a specific price point | Success - market-defining SUV |
| **Fiat Chrysler compact** | Prioritized engineering first, pricing last | Failure - poor market performance despite company size |

**Lesson:** Start with price and value, then engineer to deliver it.

## WTP Discovery Process

### Step 1: During Customer Interviews
Add pricing questions to discovery conversations:
- "How much are you paying to solve this problem today?"
- "What would be an acceptable price for a solution?"
- "At what price would you say 'that's expensive but worth it'?"
- "At what price would you walk away?"

### Step 2: Map the Responses
```
Walk-away price: $X
├── Expensive-but-worth-it: $Y
├── Acceptable: $Z
└── Current spend: $W
```

### Step 3: Segment by WTP
Group customers by their WTP ranges - this often reveals natural segments.

### Step 4: Design Product Tiers
Match features to segments based on what they value at their WTP.

## Pricing Red Flags

**Too low:**
- Sales cycle is suspiciously fast
- No pushback or negotiation
- Competitors charge significantly more
- Customers seem surprised at price

**Too high:**
- Long sales cycles with price objections
- High drop-off at pricing page
- Win rate drops sharply
- Discounting becomes standard

**Wrong model:**
- Customers confused by pricing page
- High churn after first period
- Usage doesn't match payment
- Constant billing disputes

---

## Implications for This System

**For Discovery agent:**
- Include WTP questions in customer interviews
- Track pricing signals during validation
- Identify segments by value perception

**For Strategy agent:**
- Price is part of positioning
- Pricing model is strategic choice
- Segment strategy includes pricing tiers

**For Roadmap agent:**
- Feature prioritization should consider WTP
- "Minivations" warning: don't underprice good ideas
- "Feature shock" warning: don't overbuild

## Key Quote

> "Without a price, you don't have a product."

Price isn't something you figure out at the end. It's the constraint that shapes what you build.
