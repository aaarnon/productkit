## Core Insight

Multi-product expansion is a strategic inflection point. Most startups should wait until near-extreme PMF before diversifying. The exception: when a new product strengthens your core, or you're building organizational muscles for future growth.

---

## When to Expand

### The "Half-Speed" Principle

Expand when you feel you're "pedaling at half speed" — after achieving strong PMF with steady revenue and happy customers.

**Stripe's signal:** They were "fending off leads and letting them fall on the floor" before launching new bets.

### Timing Framework

| Signal | Ready? |
|--------|--------|
| Core product has strong PMF | Required |
| Revenue is steady/growing | Required |
| Team is underutilized | Good sign |
| Market opportunity is time-sensitive | Consider early |
| New product strengthens core | Exception - can go early |

### The Exception: Early Multi-Product

Launch early **only if:**
1. The new product makes your core product more effective
2. You're building organizational muscles for future growth (cross-selling, pricing complexity)

**Example:** Atlassian built Confluence in year two partly to wire the team for cross-selling.

## Evaluating Opportunities

### Customer Workflow Expansion

Identify what complementary jobs your customers already outsource.

**Example:** Figma created FigJam when realizing design teams used separate whiteboarding tools.

**Question:** What tools do your users open alongside your product?

### Three Validation Questions

Before expanding:
1. How costly is developing an initial hypothesis?
2. How lean can investigation be?
3. How quickly will you know if it's failing?

### Data + Intuition Balance

> "The analytical approach will get you a lot of singles and doubles. But the home runs really come from those intuitive calls on how you think the market and the world is going to work and betting in that direction."

**Analytical alone misses transformative opportunities like Cash App.**

---

## Reframing: Product Completeness

### Don't Think "Multi-Product"

Think **product completeness** — solving the customer's core business problem comprehensively within one category.

| Mindset | Risk |
|---------|------|
| "Multi-product" | Seeking new PMF, losing focus |
| "Product completeness" | Deepening value in existing category |

This keeps focus tight while expanding capability.

---

## The 70:20:10 Resource Model

| Allocation | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **70%** | Core business | Main revenue product |
| **20%** | Emerging bets showing traction | Product with early signals |
| **10%** | Experimental future bets | Exploratory initiatives |

**Why it works:** Diversifies risk while maintaining focus on revenue engines.

---

## Execution Tactics

### Lean Team Launch

Start small:
- ~3 engineers
- 1 PM
- 1 designer

Scale **only after** demonstrating clear customer excitement through:
- Sales metrics
- Qualitative pull signals

**Not** after months of heavy investment.

### Consistent GTM Motion

Use identical across portfolio:
- Pricing
- Packaging
- Go-to-market strategy

**Atlassian's success:** Consistent GTM makes sales repeatable.

### Design Partner Continuity

Maintain design partnerships throughout scaling. Early feedback prevents costly misalignments that surface only after 30+ customers.

---

## Organizational Considerations

### Never Neglect Core Business

Hypergrowth requires scaling core revenue **while** expanding product lines.

**Credit Karma lesson:** When they shifted too far toward new bets, they had to recalibrate — strengthen foundational processes, teams, and measurement.

> "Unsexy but essential."

### Kill Underperforming Products

Apply same rigor to **shutdown decisions** as launch decisions.

**Dropbox example:** Killed Carousel despite beauty and passionate users. Enabled focus on SaaS revenue — critical for IPO readiness.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|-------------|
| **Over-enthusiasm without gates** | Spreads resources dangerously thin |
| **Building before understanding** | 30-50 engineers for 6-12 months with no PMF |
| **Premature expansion** | Creates chaos, dilutes competitive advantage |
| **Ignoring competitor landscape** | Misses differentiation opportunities |

### The Worst Mistake

> "I've seen projects where 30, 40, 50 engineers got invested for six months, nine months, 12 months. And they never really took off because they never understood the problem well enough that a customer could recite it back to us with extreme amounts of excitement."

## Decision Framework: Should We Expand?

### Pre-Expansion Checklist

- [ ] Core product has strong/extreme PMF
- [ ] Revenue is steady and growing
- [ ] Team has capacity (not struggling with core)
- [ ] Clear customer workflow gap identified
- [ ] Can validate hypothesis cheaply and quickly
- [ ] Have organizational ability to kill if needed

### Expansion Readiness Signals

| Signal | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Customers asking for adjacent capability | High |
| Team "pedaling at half speed" | High |
| Competitors moving into your space | Medium |
| Obvious workflow gaps | Medium |
| "Gut feeling" about market direction | Consider |

## Implications for This System

**For Strategy agent:**
- Multi-product is strategic inflection point
- Use 70:20:10 for portfolio allocation
- "Product completeness" framing keeps focus
- Kill products with same rigor as launch

**For Roadmap agent:**
- 70:20:10 affects resource allocation
- Lean team launch principle
- Design partner continuity throughout

**For Alignment agent:**
- Never neglect core during expansion
- Consistent GTM across portfolio
- Organizational muscles for cross-selling

**For Discovery agent:**
- Customer workflow expansion as opportunity source
- Three validation questions before expansion
- Pull signals > push investment
