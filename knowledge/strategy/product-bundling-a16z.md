## Core Concept

Product bundling = offering a discounted suite of products together to encourage customers to purchase multiple items rather than individually.

**Goals:**
- Increase customer stickiness
- Raise switching costs
- Drive cross-sell adoption

## When to Bundle: Three Gut-Checks

### 1. Product Maturity

Before bundling, ensure you have **several mature product offerings**. Premature bundling complicates the customer buying journey.

**Ask:** Do we have 2+ mature products that customers actually want?

### 2. Attach Rate Analysis

Your current attach rate (% of customers buying additional products) determines bundling risk:

| Attach Rate | Bundling Risk | Why |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| **Low** | Safer | Few customers pay full price for secondary products anyway |
| **High** | Risky | You'll cannibalize existing revenue by discounting products customers already buy |

**Ask:** What % of customers already buy multiple products at full price?

### 3. Competitive Landscape

Bundling works best in **competitive, commoditized markets** where stickiness and switching costs matter.

**Ask:** Are we in a competitive market where retention is critical?

## How to Bundle: Implementation Framework

### Step 1: Customer Feedback Assessment

For each product, categorize by customer segment:

| Category | Bundle Strategy |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Need** | Include without deep discounting |
| **Nice-to-have** | Include with larger discount |
| **Contested/Rejected** | Offer as standalone add-on (avoid friction) |

### Step 2: Segment-Specific Strategies

| Segment | Preference | Strategy |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Enterprise/Midmarket** | Flexibility | Mix-and-match initially → build toward ELAs |
| **SMB** | Simplicity | Curated, budget-friendly bundles with guidance |

### Step 3: Discount Rate Math

The relationship between discount and required attach rate growth is **non-linear**:

| Discount | Required Attach Rate Increase to Break Even |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| 10% | 25% |
| 20% | 67% |
| 30% | 150% |

**Key insight:** Small discounts require modest attach rate boosts. Large discounts demand dramatically higher rates.

## Testing & Monitoring

Test bundles rigorously. Track over **3 months**:

| Metric | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Attachment rate | Are more customers buying multiple products? |
| Average revenue per customer | Is total revenue going up despite discounts? |
| Net expansion rate | Are bundled customers expanding over time? |
| Churn (bundled vs single-product) | Are bundled customers stickier? |

**Don't hesitate to adjust or eliminate bundles** if adoption gains don't translate to improved customer lifetime value.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't bundle prematurely** — Need mature products first
2. **Check your attach rate** — High attach = cannialization risk
3. **Segment your approach** — Enterprise wants flexibility, SMB wants simplicity
4. **Mind the math** — Large discounts require dramatic attach rate increases
5. **Test and monitor** — Kill bundles that don't improve LTV

## When NOT to Bundle

- Products aren't mature yet
- Attach rates are already high (you'll cannibalize)
- Market isn't competitive (no need for stickiness)
- Discount math doesn't work for your margins
