## Overview

Product market fit (PMF) describes the effort required to grow your business. Strong PMF = rapid growth with little effort. Weak PMF = slow growth requiring significant effort.

> "You can always feel product/market fit when it's happening. The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it." — Marc Andreessen

## Three Dimensions of PMF

```
        Distribution
             ↑↓
    Demand ←→ Solution
```

### 1. Demand

The unmet customer need. Demand is immutable—you find it, not create it.

**Components:**
- A similar group of **people** (ICP)
- Shared unmet needs or **pain points**

**Products fail because:**
- Not enough people with the same problem
- Pain point not big enough to solve

**Examples:**
| Company | ICP | Pain Point |
|---------|-----|------------|
| **Spotify** | Music lovers | Convenient legal alternative to MP3 downloads |
| **Slack** | Knowledge workers in SMBs | Email overload, scattered communication |
| **Uber** | Urban residents | Taxis time-consuming and expensive |
| **Airbnb** | Travelers | Unique, affordable accommodation |

---

### 2. Solution

How you satisfy the demand.

**Components:**
- **Product** that meets unmet needs
- **Business model and price**

**To win against alternatives, you need:**
- **10x better product** — e.g., Tinder's mobile dating experience
- **Different value proposition** — e.g., Airbnb's room in someone's house
- **Different business model** — e.g., Netflix subscription vs. per-rental

**Pricing approaches:**
1. Value-based — What users will pay
2. Cost-based — Your cost + margin
3. Market pricing — Match or undercut alternatives
4. Market entry — Low price to dominate

**Key metric:** Gross margin = Price - Cost of revenue

---

### 3. Distribution

How people hear about your product. Also your best feedback signal.

**Distribution reveals:**
- **Demand** — Who has this problem? How severe?
- **Solution** — How well does it solve? Willingness to pay?

**Scalable GTM strategies:**
- **Online** — SEO, search, social, affiliates
- **Brand** — PR, content, events
- **Viral** — Growth loops, referrals, PLG
- **Sales** — Outbound, partners, communities

**Examples:**
| Company | Distribution Strategy |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Spotify** | Word of mouth + sharing features |
| **Slack** | Bottom-up adoption, naturally social |
| **Uber** | City-by-city PR, referral coupons |
| **Airbnb** | Viral, SEO, Craigslist cross-listing |

## Five Levels of PMF

| Level | Name | Description | Focus |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| **0** | NA | No market signals yet | Understand demand via JTBD interviews |
| **1** | Light | Small users, variable signals | Find which pain point has most potential |
| **2** | Moderate | Stable users, struggle to scale | Retention + scalable distribution |
| **3** | Strong | Steady growth, scalable channels | Operational scaling + adjacent segments |
| **4** | Intense | Hypergrowth, 10x better solution | Extend hypergrowth, lock down market share |

---

## Level 0: NA

**Status:** Pre-market, idea stage

**Focus:** Understand demand
- What are customer needs and pain points?
- How many people have similar needs?
- How severe is this need?

**Activities:**
- Jobs To Be Done interviews
- Speak to industry experts
- Minimum Viable Tests

**Warning signs:**
- Haven't spoken to anyone
- Struggling to get responses
- Experts say it won't work
- Not a priority for prospects

---

## Level 1: Light

**Status:** Small number of customers (100s self-serve, 3-5 sales-led)

**Focus:** Identify the demand pool with most potential
- Which pain point is most acute?
- Which is most prevalent?
- Which can you offer the best solution to?

**Key metric:** >40% would be "very disappointed" if product disappeared

**Warning signs:**
- Lukewarm demand across all segments
- Segment that loves product is too small
- No repeatable case studies
- Few willing to provide testimonials

---

## Level 2: Moderate

**Status:** Clarity on ICP and pain point, exploring expansion

**This is the hardest stage — where most startups fail.**

**Focus areas:**

### Retention & Activation

If customers don't stick around = leaky bucket.

**Check:** Retention curves should flatten over time, not reach zero.

**Fix retention before acquisition** — Otherwise you're burning through potential customers.

### Distribution

Move beyond tactics that don't scale.

**Key metrics:**
- CAC:ARPU ratio
- Organic brand searches
- Direct/repeat traffic

**Warning signs:**
- Majority not activating when brought to site
- Struggling to retain users (curve not flattening)
- High CAC relative to ARPU
- Distribution won't scale
- No significant month-on-month growth

---

## Level 3: Strong

**Status:** Retention curves flattening, scalable distribution working

**Indicators:**
- 5-10% monthly growth (2-3x/year)
- Blended CAC < ARPU
- Referrals happening
- Direct traffic scaling
- Path to profitability visible

**Focus areas:**

### Operational Scaling
- Scalable architecture
- Staffing (perm/contract/interns)
- Automation
- Outsourcing

### Adjacent Segments
- Keep improving product
- Optimize marketing
- Refine messaging
- Expand channels

**Warning signs:**
- User experience falling
- CAC:ARPU increasing
- Churn creeping up
- Higher disengagement signals

---

## Level 4: Intense

**Status:** >10% month-on-month growth (3x+/year)

**Hallmarks of hypergrowth:**
- Large, growing army of advocates
- Strong inbound interest
- Direct/repeat traffic growing
- Press and investor interest
- Sustained growth with incremental GTM changes

**Focus:**
- Big picture, not small details
- Remove bottlenecks to growth
- Trade short-term efficiency for growth
- Enter new geographies quickly
- Prioritize speed over risk mitigation

**Leverage competitive moats:**
- Scale economies
- Network effects
- Switching costs
- Brand

## The Feedback Loop

PMF develops through continuous iteration:

1. **Hypothesis** — Concept for demand + solution
2. **Initial discovery** — Feedback drives initial build
3. **Innovators** — Early users reveal true demand
4. **Iteration** — Improve solution to match demand
5. **Early adopters** — Experiment with distribution
6. **Crunch time** — More feedback from scaling
7. **Iteration** — Double down on what works
8. **Scalable adoption** — Understanding improves, growth increases

---

## Examples of Intense PMF

| Company | Growth Signal |
|---------|---------------|
| **ChatGPT** | 1M users in first 5 days |
| **Monzo** | 70K → 600K customers in 2017 |
| **Figma** | $4M → $450M ARR (2018-2022) |

## Summary

### Three Dimensions

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Demand** | How big is the pool? How acute is the pain? |
| **Solution** | How well does product solve the pain? |
| **Distribution** | How do you reach potential customers? |

### Five Levels

| Level | Key Focus |
|-------|-----------|
| **0: NA** | Understand demand |
| **1: Light** | Find best demand pool |
| **2: Moderate** | Retention + scalable distribution |
| **3: Strong** | Operational scaling + adjacent segments |
| **4: Intense** | Extend hypergrowth, lock market share |

### Key Takeaways

1. **PMF is a spectrum** — Not binary; you can have degrees of fit
2. **Market matters most** — You can't control demand, only find it
3. **10x or different** — Solution must be dramatically better or different
4. **Distribution is feedback** — Your best source of demand/solution insights
5. **Retention before acquisition** — Fix the leaky bucket first
6. **Level 2 is hardest** — Where most startups fail
7. **PMF is not static** — Market moves; you can slip backward
8. **Iterate continuously** — Each dimension informs the others
