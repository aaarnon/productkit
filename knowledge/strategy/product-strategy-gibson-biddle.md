## Overview

Six interconnected frameworks for defining product strategy. These tools answer four core strategic questions and work together as a system.

## Framework #1: Positioning and Branding

Define your product through three questions:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What is it? | Simple description (6th-grade language) |
| What are the benefits? | Customer value proposition |
| What's the personality? | Brand character |

### Netflix Example

- **What is it?** Monthly subscription for TV and movies
- **Benefits?** Fast, easy, entertaining, great value
- **Personality?** Straightforward, friendly
- **Brand promise:** "Movie Enjoyment Made Easy"

---

## Framework #2: GLEE Model

A long-term vision broken into 3-5 year stages:

| Letter | Meaning | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| G | Get big | Establish initial market position |
| L | Lead | Dominate your category |
| E | Expand | Enter adjacent markets |
| E | Expand | Continue expansion into new areas |

### Netflix GLEE Vision

1. **G**et big on DVDs
2. **L**ead streaming
3. **E**xpand internationally
4. **E**xpand into games

**Purpose:** Encourages aspirational thinking about market trends your product can capture and competitive advantages you'll establish.

---

## Framework #3: GEM Model

Force-rank three company priorities with proxy metrics:

| Priority | What It Measures | Netflix Proxy Metric |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Growth** | Customer acquisition | Year-over-year customer growth rate |
| **Engagement** | Product quality | Monthly retention (~98%) |
| **Monetization** | Revenue efficiency | Average revenue per member ($15) |

### Key Principle

**You must force-rank these.** You can't say all three are equally important.

**Netflix prioritization today:** Growth > Monetization > Engagement

---

## Framework #4: DHM Model

The core framework for creating sustainable competitive advantage:

### D = Delight

Deliver a product customers rave about.

**Netflix Example:** Offering 100,000 DVD titles versus Blockbuster's 5,000 created compelling differentiation.

**Key Question:** What makes customers say "I love this product"?

---

### H = Hard-to-Copy

Eight potential sources of competitive moats:

| # | Attribute | Description | Netflix Example |
|---|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Brand** | Trusted customer relationships | 25-year trust enabling new ventures |
| 2 | **Network Effects** | Value increases as network grows | Netflix Ready Devices ecosystem |
| 3 | **Unique Technology** | Hard-to-build capabilities | Personalization across billions of profiles |
| 4 | **Economies of Scale** | Declining unit costs | $20B content budget amortized across 300M members |
| 5 | **Switching Costs** | Difficulty migrating to competitors | Minimal for Netflix; stronger in enterprise |
| 6 | **Counter-Positioning** | Business model incumbents can't replicate | "No Late Fees" vs Blockbuster's late-fee revenue |
| 7 | **Captured Resources** | Patents or exceptional talent | Early triumvirate: Hastings, McCord, Hunt |
| 8 | **Process Power** | Operational excellence hard to replicate | Film re-encoding across thousands of flavors |

---

### M = Margin-Enhancing

Business model innovations that improve economics.

**Netflix Experiments:**
- À la carte DVD service (failed)
- "All-you-can-eat" subscription (won)
- Ad-supported plans
- Sub-account payments
- Multi-household plans
- Personalization-driven budget forecasting

---

## Framework #5: SMT Lockup

**Strategy → Metric → Tactic** alignment:

```
STRATEGY  →  What high-level hypothesis are we testing?
    │
    ▼
METRIC    →  How will we know if it's working?
    │
    ▼
TACTIC    →  What specific projects will we execute?
```

### Building Proxy Metrics

**Formula:** "Percentage of [user segment] performing [minimum action] by [timeframe]"

### Netflix Personalization Example (~2005)

| Component | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Strategy** | Improve member movie discovery |
| **Metric** | "Percentage of new members rating 50+ films in first six weeks" |
| **Tactics** | Rating UI improvements, recommendation algorithm, merchandising optimization |

### SMT Process

1. Define 4-6 high-level product strategies
2. Assign proxy metrics for each strategy
3. Identify specific projects (tactics) supporting each strategy

---

## Framework #6: Product Roadmap

Organize quarterly initiatives by **swimlane** (product team/area):

| Quarter | Swimlane A | Swimlane B | Swimlane C |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| Q1 | Tactic 1 (Strategy X) | Tactic 4 (Strategy Y) | Tactic 7 (Strategy Z) |
| Q2 | Tactic 2 (Strategy X) | Tactic 5 (Strategy Y) | Tactic 8 (Strategy Z) |
| Q3 | Tactic 3 (Strategy X) | Tactic 6 (Strategy Y) | Tactic 9 (Strategy Z) |

**Key:** Each tactic connects to a strategic priority and has a clear timeline.

---

## Organizational Alignment

### Top-Down + Bottom-Up Meeting in the Middle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     HEAD OF PRODUCT                     │
│     Creates top-down strategy           │
│              │                          │
│              ▼                          │
│     ════════════════════                │
│     ITERATIVE ALIGNMENT                 │
│     ════════════════════                │
│              ▲                          │
│              │                          │
│     SWIMLANE LEADERS                    │
│     Develop bottom-up execution         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Key Insights

### Success Rate Reality

> "Even world-class product organizations get it right less than half the time."

Netflix achieved objectives with only **5 of 10** major strategies examined.

### SWAG Evolution

Start with a **"stupid wild-ass guess"**, then iterate toward a **"scientific wild-ass guess"** through testing and learning.

### The Real Value

The frameworks force structured thinking and alignment—the process matters as much as the output.

---

## Exercises for Implementation

### Exercise 1: Delight
Describe your current customer satisfaction level and identify 3 improvements that would make customers rave about you.

### Exercise 2: Hard-to-Copy
Map the eight attributes to your specific advantages. Where are you strong? Where are you vulnerable?

### Exercise 3: Margin-Enhancing
List business model experiments to run in the next 2-3 years.

### Exercise 4: SMT Development
For each team, articulate: Strategy → Metric → Tactic connections.

### Exercise 5: Bottom-Up Alternative
Sort your essential projects into thematic buckets—these reveal your implicit strategies.

## Summary: The Six Frameworks

| # | Framework | Purpose | Key Output |
|---|-----------|---------|------------|
| 1 | **Positioning** | Define what you are | Brand promise |
| 2 | **GLEE** | Long-term vision | 3-5 year stage plan |
| 3 | **GEM** | Prioritize focus areas | Force-ranked priorities |
| 4 | **DHM** | Build competitive advantage | Moat strategy |
| 5 | **SMT** | Align execution to strategy | Strategy-metric-tactic lockup |
| 6 | **Roadmap** | Organize work over time | Swimlane-based quarterly plan |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Strategy is a system** — The six frameworks work together, not in isolation
2. **Force decisions** — GEM requires ranking; you can't have three #1 priorities
3. **Build moats deliberately** — Use the 8 hard-to-copy attributes as a checklist
4. **Connect tactics to strategy** — Every project should trace to an SMT lockup
5. **Expect failure** — Even great teams succeed less than half the time; iterate quickly
6. **Start with SWAG** — Perfect data isn't coming; make educated guesses and test them
