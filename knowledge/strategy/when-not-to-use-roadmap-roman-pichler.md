## Introduction

The product roadmap is a popular product management tool that communicates how a product is likely to evolve. But despite its popularity, it's not always applicable. There are three scenarios in which using a roadmap is not advisable.

## Three Scenarios When NOT to Use a Roadmap

### Scenario 1: Limited Visibility (Can't See Beyond 3 Months)

**The Problem:**

A product roadmap should be a realistic forecast that states the specific value a product is likely to offer in the next 12 months. Creating such a forecast is not always feasible, especially when you work on a new, innovative product.

**If you can't see further than the next three months, then do NOT use a product roadmap.**

Otherwise, your plan is likely to be wrong, which would lead to:
- Disappointed stakeholders and development teams
- In the worst case, they'll lose trust in you

**The Alternative - Outcome-Based Goal:**

Instead of building a roadmap, set a **single, outcome-based goal for the next three months**. The goal should state the positive impact you want to create for the users/customers and the business.

**Example:** For a healthy-eating app:
> "Help users understand their eating habits and acquire an initial user base."

Use this three-month objective to guide feature prioritization in your backlog.

### Scenario 2: Lack of Validated Product Strategy

**The Problem:**

If you don't have a validated strategy, you lack the basis for developing a realistic, actionable product roadmap.

**What is a Validated Strategy?**

A validated strategy contains relevant data to show that you have made the right strategic decisions:
- Selected the right target group
- Identified the right needs
- Set appropriate business goals
- Chosen the right standout features

**If that's the case, STOP and carry out the necessary strategy discovery work. Then continue building the roadmap.**

**The Four-Step Strategy Discovery Process:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. SELECT      →  Identify the biggest risk in        │
│                    your strategy                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. DETERMINE   →  How to best address the risk        │
│                    (user observation, prototypes, etc.) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. EXECUTE     →  Carry out the work and collect      │
│                    relevant data                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4. EVALUATE    →  Use insights to correct and         │
│                    refine the strategy                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↑                                    │
         └────────────────────────────────────┘
              Repeat until all major risks addressed
```

With a validated strategy in place, you are in a great position to build a realistic, actionable product roadmap.

### Scenario 3: Stakeholder Control and Fixed Commitments

**The Problem:**

When stakeholders demand specific features and treat the roadmap as unchangeable, two underlying issues exist:

1. **Product managers lack sufficient empowerment** to decline requests
2. **Stakeholders expect traditional, feature-based planning** rather than outcome-oriented, adaptive approaches

**Risks of Proceeding Anyway:**

- Creates a **"Frankenstein product"** — a loose collection of features that might please stakeholders but don't create much value for users and the business
- Treating roadmaps as fixed commitments can trigger **unsustainable "death march" work cycles**
- Harms team health and software quality

**The Alternative - Collaborative Goal Setting:**

Collaboratively establish a **three-month goal with stakeholders**.

**Benefits of this approach:**
1. Increased stakeholder support
2. Enhanced trust relationships
3. A transition pathway toward outcome-based roadmaps

---

## The Outcome-Based Goal Approach

When you can't use a full roadmap, use a single outcome-based goal:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Timeframe** | Next 3 months (one quarter) |
| **Focus** | Positive impact for users AND business |
| **Format** | Single, clear statement |
| **Use** | Guides backlog prioritization |

**This approach is essentially a single OKR** — an Objective with implied Key Results around the stated outcome.

---

## Key Connections

### Strategy → Roadmap Dependency

```
Validated Strategy  →  Roadmap Goals  →  Product Backlog
        ↑                                       │
        └───────── Learning & Feedback ─────────┘
```

**You cannot have a good roadmap without a validated strategy.**

### Roadmap Readiness Checklist

Before creating a roadmap, verify:

- [ ] Can you realistically forecast 6-12 months ahead?
- [ ] Is your product strategy validated with data?
- [ ] Do you have empowerment to make product decisions?
- [ ] Are stakeholders aligned on outcome-based (not feature-based) planning?

If any answer is "No," use the **3-month outcome goal** approach instead.

---

## Summary

| Scenario | Problem | Alternative |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Limited visibility** | Can't see past 3 months | Set single quarterly outcome goal |
| **No validated strategy** | No data-backed strategy | Run Strategy Discovery process |
| **Stakeholder control** | Features dictated, roadmap fixed | Collaborative 3-month goal setting |

**Core insight:** A roadmap is not always the right tool. When conditions aren't met, outcome-based quarterly goals provide a more honest and effective planning approach.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Roadmaps require realistic forecasting** — If you can't see 6-12 months ahead, don't pretend you can
2. **Strategy must be validated first** — Run the 4-step discovery process before roadmapping
3. **Empowerment matters** — Without it, roadmaps become wish lists
4. **Outcome goals as stepping stones** — 3-month goals build trust and transition toward full roadmaps
5. **Honesty over false certainty** — Better to have a credible short-term goal than an unrealistic long-term roadmap
