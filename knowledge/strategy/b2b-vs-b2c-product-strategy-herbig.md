## Core Insight

B2B and B2C product strategy are more similar than most teams think. The fundamental patterns are the same - differences mostly come from company-specific practices, not inherent B2B/B2C distinctions.

## Key Differences

| Dimension | B2C | B2B |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Course correction** | Easier to change direction | Harder - decisions have bigger organizational impact |
| **Target segment changes** | Can shift personas fairly easily | May require reorganizing entire team |
| **Experimentation** | Faster testing and piloting | Longer evaluation cycles |
| **User definition** | A user is a user | Buyer vs user distinction, multiple stakeholders |
| **Decision risk** | Lower impact per decision | Higher stakes, longer evaluation |

## Flexibility and Course Correction

Changing course in B2C is often simpler than in B2B:

- **B2C:** You can build a product for a target segment and change that persona fairly easily (as long as you understand it)
- **B2B:** If you make certain decisions, you may have to reorganize your team - the impact is bigger, riskier, and evaluation takes longer

## B2B/B2C Hybrid Models

Many products are actually hybrids where B2C delivery involves B2B enablers.

**Example: heycar**
- Sells second-hand cars to consumers (B2C)
- Must involve local car dealers to create supply (B2B)
- Vast majority of product experience aims at B2C
- But must also plan for serving B2B audiences

**Implication:** Don't assume pure B2B or B2C - identify where your product sits on the spectrum.

## Applying Strategy Patterns

A high-level check illuminates where your company stands on the three fundamentals of product strategy - independent of B2B or B2C nature:

1. **Strategic Narrative** - Vision, goals, the WHY
2. **Playing Field** - Market, segments, jobs, alternatives
3. **Winning Moves** - Value props, differentiation, channels

These patterns help differentiate and prioritize between different levels of strategy goals regardless of business model.

## So What?

Don't let B2B vs B2C labels dictate your strategy approach. Instead:

1. Start with fundamental strategy patterns (they're the same)
2. Adapt based on your specific context (company stage, complexity, stakeholders)
3. Recognize hybrid models where both B2B and B2C considerations apply
4. Account for the higher organizational impact of B2B decisions in your planning timeline
