## Core Insight

You cannot design an evidence-based Product Strategy in one workshop session. Don't cut corners by starting with the current trendy template.

Focus on **patterns** (flexible, context-dependent) instead of **templates** (rigid, prescriptive).

## The 3 Product Strategy Patterns

Every product strategy, regardless of company or industry, can be understood through three fundamental patterns. These patterns influence each other: shifting one affects the others.

## Pattern Details

### 1. Strategic Narrative

Create an inspiring narrative through:
- **Product Vision:** The future state for your users that emerges from the value your product provides. Defines WHERE you are going.
- **North Star Metric:** The single metric that captures the value you deliver.
- **Goals:** Mid-to-long-term objectives that ladder up to vision.

### 2. Playing Field

Define your strategic playing field through:
- **Prioritized audiences:** Who are you building for? (users AND buyers if different)
- **Progress they care about:** What jobs are they trying to get done?
- **Alternatives:** What are users comparing you against? (not just competitors - includes doing nothing, manual workarounds, etc.)

### 3. Winning Moves

Outline explicit choices to position your product:
- **Segment focus:** Which customer segments get priority?
- **Value propositions:** What specific value do you deliver to each segment?
- **Channels:** How do you reach and serve customers?
- **Differentiators:** What makes you defensibly different?

## Product Vision vs Product Strategy

| Concept | Definition | Question |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Product Vision** | Future state for users from your product's value | WHERE are we going? |
| **Product Strategy** | Most promising direction to reach that future state | HOW will we get there? |

---

## Self-Check Questions

Use these to assess your strategy completeness:

1. **Strategic Narrative:** Do we have one? What's missing?
2. **Playing Field:** How clear is it? What's missing?
3. **Winning Moves:** Do we know them beyond a feature list? What's missing?

---

## Why Patterns Over Templates

| Templates | Patterns |
|-----------|----------|
| Impose linear sequences | Flexible structures |
| "Best practices" that may not fit | Adapt to your context |
| Process compliance focus | Strategic decision focus |
| One-size-fits-all | Reusable but customizable |

---

## Connecting the Dots

Product Strategy patterns connect three elements:

```
Product Strategy ←→ OKRs ←→ Product Discovery
      ↓                           ↓
  Direction              Validation of assumptions
      ↓                           ↓
           Measurable progress
```

By focusing on patterns across Strategic Narrative, Playing Field, and Winning Moves, you discover the right-now strategy that keeps your product aligned to company values while moving forward.

## So What?

1. Stop looking for the "right" strategy template
2. Assess your current state against the 3 patterns
3. Identify gaps in each pattern
4. Use context (company stage, market, resources) to fill gaps
5. Connect strategy to OKRs and discovery for evidence-based execution
