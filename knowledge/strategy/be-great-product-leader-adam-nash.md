## Core Insight

> **Strategy should make prioritization obvious.**

Great product leadership comes down to three responsibilities: Strategy, Prioritization, and Execution. But Strategy is the foundation — without clarity on **what game you're playing** and **how you keep score**, everything else becomes harder.

---

## The Three Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Core Question | Output |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **1. Strategy** | What game? How to score? | Clarity and alignment |
| **2. Prioritization** | What 3 things next? | Focus and sequencing |
| **3. Execution** | How do we ship? | Results and iteration |

---

## Strategy: Know Your Game + Keep Score

### The Two Questions

Every product leader must answer:

1. **"What game are we playing?"**
2. **"How do we keep score?"**

These aren't just leadership exercises — they're alignment tools.

### Why This Matters

> "Clearly describing the game you're playing and the metrics you use to judge success allows the team, independent of the product manager, to sort through different ideas."

When strategy is clear:
- Team can self-prioritize
- Debates resolve faster
- Wrong ideas get filtered early
- Right ideas get recognized

When strategy is unclear:
- Every decision requires PM input
- Debates never end
- Good ideas compete with bad ideas equally
- Team feels lost

### Know Your Game

Every product is engaged in its own strategic game. The leader's task is to articulate this clearly:

| Component | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Objective** | What are we trying to achieve? |
| **Customer value** | What problem do we solve? |
| **Differentiation** | Why us over alternatives? |
| **Constraints** | What are we NOT doing? |

**Examples of "games":**
- "We're playing the engagement game — get users to spend more time"
- "We're playing the conversion game — turn free users into paid"
- "We're playing the expansion game — grow into adjacent markets"
- "We're playing the retention game — reduce churn at all costs"

### Keep Score

Metrics that define success. Without scorekeeping:
- You can't tell if you're winning
- You can't prioritize effectively
- You can't learn from results

**Good scorekeeping:**
- 1-3 primary metrics (not 10)
- Leading AND lagging indicators
- Shared across the team
- Reviewed regularly

---

## Prioritization: The Three Things

With strategy clear, prioritization becomes about **sequencing**.

### The Question

> "What are the three things we're doing next?"

Not five. Not ten. **Three.**

### Why Companies Fail

> "Companies often fail not from lacking great concepts but from sequencing them poorly."

**Common failure modes:**
- Doing everything at once (diluted impact)
- Wrong sequence (dependencies broken)
- Changing priorities constantly (nothing ships)
- No priorities at all (chaos)

### When Strategy Works

If strategy is clear, prioritization should be **obvious**:
- The "game" tells you what matters
- The "score" tells you what to improve
- The sequence becomes apparent

If prioritization is hard, revisit strategy.

## Execution: Cover the Gaps

Product managers "cover whatever gaps in the process that need to be covered."

### Critical Execution Elements

| Element | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Clear specs** | Team knows what to build |
| **Edge case triage** | Rapid decisions on ambiguity |
| **Trade-off management** | Time vs benefit decisions |
| **Data analysis** | Performance tracking |

### The Force Multiplier Effect

Great PMs are **force multipliers** — they help cross-functional teams perform optimally.

**Signs of a great PM:**
- Shipping accelerates
- Analysis improves
- Priorities become clear
- Key metrics move

## The Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           STRATEGY                  │
│   What game? How to keep score?     │
│                                     │
│   (Makes prioritization obvious)    │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         PRIORITIZATION              │
│   What 3 things are we doing next?  │
│                                     │
│   (Makes execution focused)         │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           EXECUTION                 │
│   Specs, decisions, trade-offs      │
│                                     │
│   (Produces results)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight:** Problems at lower levels often trace to unclear strategy at the top.

## Diagnostic Questions

### Is Your Strategy Clear?

- [ ] Can every team member articulate the game?
- [ ] Do they know how we keep score?
- [ ] Can they self-filter ideas without PM input?
- [ ] Do debates resolve quickly?

### Is Your Prioritization Working?

- [ ] Are you focused on 3 things (not 10)?
- [ ] Is the sequence obvious from strategy?
- [ ] Are priorities stable (not constantly shifting)?
- [ ] Does the team know what's NOT being done?

### Is Execution Effective?

- [ ] Are you shipping regularly?
- [ ] Are edge cases resolved quickly?
- [ ] Is the team unblocked?
- [ ] Are metrics moving?

## Implications for This System

**For Strategy agent (PRIMARY):**
- Always establish "Know Your Game" before any other strategy work
- Always establish "Keep Score" metrics
- Test: "If strategy is clear, prioritization should be obvious"
- If prioritization is hard, revisit strategy first

**For Orchestrator:**
- Check if user knows their game and score
- Missing game/score = start with Strategy agent
- This is foundational context for all other work

**For Metrics agent:**
- "Keep Score" is the bridge between strategy and metrics
- Primary metrics should reflect the "game"
- Help teams define 1-3 metrics, not 10

**For Roadmap agent:**
- Prioritization is sequencing, not just ranking
- "Three things next" as forcing function
- If prioritization is hard, strategy is unclear

**For Prioritization skill:**
- Strategy should make priority obvious
- If it's not obvious, escalate to strategy discussion

## Quick Reference

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| Team can't self-filter ideas | Strategy unclear — define the game |
| Debates never resolve | Strategy unclear — define the score |
| Prioritization is hard | Strategy unclear — revisit game + score |
| Too many priorities | Force "three things next" |
| Execution is slow | Check for gaps PM should cover |
| Metrics aren't moving | Check alignment between game + score |
