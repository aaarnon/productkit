## Overview

April Dunford's positioning framework helps companies make their "awesomeness obvious" by examining unique strengths and placing them at the center of market positioning. The approach challenges the traditional positioning statement format in favor of a more dynamic, five-step process.

## The 5-Step Framework

### Step 1: Let Go of Where You Came From

**Purpose:** Release the "default" market position rooted in product history.

**Key Concept:** Products often evolve beyond their original market context. Hanging onto historical positioning obscures true value.

**Questions to Ask:**
- What market did we originally target?
- How has our offering evolved since inception?
- Are we highlighting weaknesses by staying in the original market?

**Example:** A database company founded by database experts realized they weren't competing effectively as a "database" because prospects compared them to Oracle. By repositioning as a Business Intelligence tool, they highlighted their actual differentiator: "fast data analysis on large datasets."

---

### Step 2: Isolate Your Uniqueness

**Purpose:** Identify what you alone can deliver—without judgment about value yet.

**Key Concept:** Document features, intellectual property, business models, processes, and supply chain advantages that competitors lack.

**Questions to Ask:**
- What features do we have that no competitor offers?
- What proprietary processes or technology are unique to us?
- What business model elements differentiate us?
- What relationships or assets do only we possess?

**Important Note:** Even attributes that seem like weaknesses (complexity, niche focus) can become strengths in the right context.

### Step 3: Value—What Can Your Uniqueness Do for Customers?

**Purpose:** Connect unique features to tangible customer outcomes.

**Key Concept:** "Customers don't care about your unique features, they care what those features can do for them."

**Translation Process:**
- Feature → Customer benefit
- Example: "Patented fast query technology" → "Companies can answer customer questions immediately rather than calling back the next day"

**Questions to Ask:**
- What business problems does our uniqueness solve?
- What outcomes can customers achieve with our offering?
- What possibilities does our uniqueness enable?
- Can combinations of features create additional value?

---

### Step 4: Who Cares?

**Purpose:** Identify which prospects most value your differentiators.

**Key Concept:** "Many kinds of prospects care about what you deliver but only some of them REALLY care."

**Questions to Ask:**
- Which customer segments have acute pain around this value?
- What characteristics define our best-fit prospects?
- What makes certain customers particularly interested in our solution?
- How do high-value customers differ from low-value ones?
- Who would buy fastest with fewer discount requests?

**Specificity Requirement:** Move beyond broad categories (e.g., "small businesses") to precise characteristics.

---

### Step 5: Choose Your Best Market Frame of Reference

**Purpose:** Select the market category that makes your differentiation obviously valuable.

**Key Concept:** Your market frame of reference shapes prospect expectations about competitors, pricing, features, and partnerships.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Which market frame makes our core value immediately obvious?
- What are alternative market categories we could occupy?
- Which frame reduces direct competition with stronger players?
- Which frame aligns with how our best customers think about problems?

**Strategic Options:**
- **Head-to-head competition** in existing markets
- **Segment ownership** by splitting a niche you can dominate
- **Category innovation** by changing how the market thinks about solutions
- **New category creation** (most difficult)

---

## Output: Positioning Template

Once you complete the five steps, document your positioning:

1. **Market frame of reference**
2. **Target customer characteristics**
3. **Unique capabilities/strengths**
4. **Customer value outcomes**
5. **Competitive differentiation**
6. **Date of last review**

---

## Positioning Statement Format

```
For [Target Customer]
Who [need/problem]
[Product] is a [Market Category]
That [Key Benefit]
Unlike [Competitive Alternative]
We [Key Differentiator]
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Assuming one "correct" position exists** when multiple viable markets could work
2. **Completing the exercise once** rather than monitoring for market shifts
3. **Failing to let go** of original market context when products have evolved
4. **Positioning vaguely** ("we serve small businesses") instead of precisely
5. **Skipping internal alignment** on the implications of repositioning decisions
6. **Treating positioning as static** when markets and competitors change

---

## Weak Positioning Symptoms

- Prospects ask "what exactly is this product for?"
- Sales cycles are longer than expected
- Customers request significant discounts
- Target market feedback contradicts your assumptions
- Market changes erode your differentiation

---

## Key Distinction

### Positioning ≠ Messaging

Your positioning template informs—but isn't—your marketing message. Once positioning is established, develop detailed messaging documents that address specific buyer personas.

## Summary

### The 5 Steps

| Step | Question | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | What market context are we stuck in? | Freedom from historical positioning |
| 2 | What makes us unique? | List of differentiators |
| 3 | What value does uniqueness provide? | Customer outcomes |
| 4 | Who cares most about this value? | Target customer profile |
| 5 | What market frame makes value obvious? | Market category choice |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Multiple positions possible** - Every product can be positioned multiple ways
2. **Let go of history** - Original market may not be best market
3. **Features → Value** - Translate unique features into customer outcomes
4. **Specificity matters** - "Small businesses" is not specific enough
5. **Market frame is strategic** - Choose category that highlights your strengths
6. **Iterate regularly** - Markets change, positioning should too
