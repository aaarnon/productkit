## Core Insight

"What got you here won't get you there" - PM work and team structure must evolve with company stage. Misaligning team capabilities with company phase creates friction and limits growth.

---

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: "Drunken Walk" (Pre-PMF)

**Focus:** Discovering product-market fit through rapid experimentation.

**PM Role:**
- Primarily project management, not product strategy
- Coordinating releases, running standups
- Executing the founder's vision (founder IS the PM)
- Learning and iterating fast

**Team Structure:**
- Founder-led; minimal dedicated PM headcount
- Engineers building, founder deciding what to build

**Key Challenge:** When to add the first PM? Too early = PM has no leverage. Too late = founder bottleneck.

**Hiring Advice:** Seek candidates who can grow into leadership rather than purely junior talent. Watch for those passionate about customers, not just process.

---

### Phase 2: Product-Market Fit

**Focus:** Transition to sustainable growth by doubling down on what works.

**PM Role:**
- Roadmap planning and cross-functional communication
- Predictable delivery while founders handle company scaling
- Introducing necessary process (standups, sprints, retros)
- Bridging engineering and business

**Team Structure:**
- 2-3 PMs per 25 engineers
- PMs own specific product areas

**Key Challenge:** Introducing process without killing speed. Balance structure with agility.

**Hiring Advice:** Prioritize PMs with prior scale experience who understand how to introduce process thoughtfully - they've "seen the movie before."

---

### Phase 3: Hypergrowth

**Focus:** Balance scaling existing products with innovation across new offerings.

**PM Role:**
- Truly strategic: articulating long-term vision across multiple quarters
- Building leadership layers that make autonomous decisions
- Managing portfolio of bets (core vs. new)
- Cross-team coordination and trade-offs

**Team Structure:**
- Multiple sub-organizations with ownership
- PM managers and directors emerge
- Specialized roles (growth PM, platform PM, etc.)

**Key Challenge:** Balancing execution on core business with new bets. Not starving innovation.

**Hiring Advice:** Recruit "entrepreneurs at scale" - people comfortable operating across both scrappy and large-org environments. Often former founders or early-stage operators who've also seen scale.

---

### Phase 4: Scale (Mature)

**Focus:** Sustaining growth and navigating organizational complexity.

**PM Role:**
- Executive-level product leadership
- Portfolio strategy across business units
- Organizational design and talent development
- External positioning and partnerships

**Team Structure:**
- Full PM organization with CPO/VP-level leadership
- Specialized teams by product line, platform, growth
- Clear career ladders and specialization paths

## Summary Table

| Phase | PM Focus | Team Ratio | Key Hire Trait |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Phase 1: Drunken Walk** | Execution/logistics | Founder-led | Can grow into leadership |
| **Phase 2: PMF** | Delivery & communication | ~2-3 PM per 25 eng | Has seen scale before |
| **Phase 3: Hypergrowth** | Strategy & innovation | Sub-orgs with ownership | Entrepreneur at scale |
| **Phase 4: Scale** | Portfolio & org design | Full PM org | Executive presence |

## Implications for This System

**For Orchestrator:**
- Company stage determines appropriate PM frameworks and advice
- Pre-PMF companies shouldn't obsess over OKRs or complex roadmaps
- Post-PMF companies need more process, not less
- Advice must match where the company actually is, not where they think they are

**For Strategy Agent:**
- Four Types of Product Work maps to these stages
- Phase 1 = PMF work. Phase 2 = Feature + Growth. Phase 3 = all four types.
- Strategy complexity should match company stage

**For Alignment Agent:**
- Process needs scale with company stage
- Don't prescribe Phase 3 process to Phase 1 company
- Quarterly strategy meetings make sense at Phase 2+, not Phase 1

---

## Red Flags by Phase

| Phase | Warning Sign |
|-------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | PM spending time on process instead of customer discovery |
| Phase 2 | Still operating like Phase 1 (chaos, no predictability) |
| Phase 3 | All resources on core, no new bets; OR too many bets, nothing shipping |
| Phase 4 | Innovation theater, bureaucracy killing speed |

## Key Quote

> "What got you here won't get you there."

The PM skills and processes that worked at one stage actively harm you at the next. Recognizing the transition and evolving is critical.
