# Six Key Steps to Production Process

**Source:** Hustle Badger

## Overview

This framework outlines the end-to-end product development lifecycle, from strategic objectives through to post-launch analysis. Each stage has specific inputs, activities, and outputs that feed into the next phase.

## The Six Stages

```
Objective → Problems → Ideation → Exploration → Delivery → Follow up
    ↑                                                           |
    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    (Feedback loop)
```

## Stage Details

### 1. Objective

**Description:** The value the business wants to realize

**Example:** The OKR

**Inputs:**
- Company strategy
- Existing knowledge
- Management discussions

**Outputs:**
- Inspiring **Objective** (qualitative)
- Quantified **Key Results** (metric with baseline and target)

---

### 2. Problems

**Description:** The user problems/opportunities we need to address to capture this value

**Example:** Focus on signup > download

**Inputs:**
- Quantitative research
- Qualitative research
- Competitor benchmarking
- Technical investigation

**Outputs:**
- 2-3 quantified problems that the team aims to solve

---

### 3. Ideation

**Description:** The ideas we have to solve the user problems

**Example:** Username generator

**Inputs:**
- Input from team

**Outputs:**
- Prioritized backlog
- One-pagers containing:
  - Impact
  - Effort
  - Confidence
  - Description
  - Hypothesis

---

### 4. Exploration

**Description:** How we flesh out the ideas into something we can build

**Example:** User testing

**Inputs:**
- User testing
- Technical spikes
- Scoping

**Outputs:**
- Detailed understanding of what we will build

---

### 5. Delivery

**Description:** How we build a feature

**Example:** Tickets and features built from them

**Inputs:**
- Development tickets:
  - Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
  - Designs
  - Tracking
- Comms & roll-out plan

**Outputs:**
- Features live to users, delivering business value

---

### 6. Follow Up

**Description:** What happens once the feature is live

**Example:** Results of A/B test

**Inputs:**
- Impact assessment
- Deep dive analysis

**Outputs:**
- New inputs for other stages in production process (feedback loop)

## Summary Table

| Stage | What It Answers | Key Output |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **Objective** | What value do we want? | OKR with baseline & target |
| **Problems** | What's blocking that value? | 2-3 quantified problems |
| **Ideation** | How might we solve it? | Prioritized backlog + one-pagers |
| **Exploration** | What exactly will we build? | Detailed spec/understanding |
| **Delivery** | How do we build it? | Live features |
| **Follow Up** | Did it work? | Learnings → new inputs |

---

## Key Insights

1. **Cyclical process** — Follow-up outputs become inputs for future objectives
2. **Each stage has clear handoffs** — Outputs of one stage are inputs for the next
3. **Problems before solutions** — Ideation only happens after problems are quantified
4. **One-pagers are central** — Capture impact, effort, confidence, hypothesis
5. **Exploration validates** — User testing and spikes before delivery
6. **Measurement is required** — Follow-up closes the loop with impact assessment
