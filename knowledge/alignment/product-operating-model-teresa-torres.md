## Core Definition

A conceptual model based on first principles that leading product companies believe to be true about creating products.

**Applies to three dimensions:**
1. How products are built
2. How problems are solved
3. Deciding which problems to solve

**Core priority:** Achieving **outcomes versus merely producing output**

---

## Three Foundational Principles

### 1. Outcome Focus

Teams measure success by **impact rather than deliverables**.

- ✗ Track features shipped
- ✓ Evaluate whether features achieve desired business and customer outcomes

---

### 2. Continuous Discovery

Teams engage in **weekly customer touchpoints** through:
- Interviews
- Research activities
- Assumption testing

**Purpose:** Identify and validate problems worth solving

---

### 3. Cross-Functional Collaboration

**Product trios** work together from inception:
- Product Manager
- Designer
- Engineer

**Combines perspectives:** Business + Customer + Technical

---

## Why Organizations Adopt This Model

Companies pursue transformation when facing:
- Increased competitive pressure
- Technology investments yielding insufficient returns
- Recognition that current approaches won't sustain future success

**Balances:** Customer satisfaction + Business objectives

## Project vs Product Operating Models

| Aspect | Project Model | Product Model |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Timeline** | Defined beginnings and endings | Continuous evolution |
| **Funding** | Budget by project | Funding by outcomes or teams |
| **Learning** | Limited from delivered work | Embedded learning and iteration |
| **Measurement** | Completion | Actual impact |
| **Risk** | One-way handoffs | Continuous collaboration |

---

## Implementation: Pilot Team Approach

**Don't:** Organization-wide transformation

**Do:** Start with pilot teams—small groups to demonstrate viability

### Pilot Team Selection Criteria

Choose teams with:
- ✓ Strong existing relationships and collaboration ability
- ✓ Growth mindset and willingness to learn
- ✓ Complete skill sets (product, design, engineering)
- ✓ Regular customer access
- ✓ Products in early lifecycle stages

---

### Setting Pilot Teams for Success

Pilot teams require:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Clear business context** | Tied to outcomes |
| **Customer access** | For regular interviews |
| **Evaluation methods** | For validating solutions |
| **Faster delivery cycles** | Enabled by right-sized work |
| **Collaboration skills** | Cross-functional |

---

## Organizational Role Transformations

### CEO Responsibilities

Must believe:
- Current operations won't ensure future success
- Experience pain from status quo

**Why:** This belief sustains commitment through transformation challenges

---

### Product Leadership

**Shifts from:**
- Directive management
- Controlling specific deliverables

**Shifts to:**
- Coaching and developing team skills
- Managing by outcomes

---

### Product Teams

**Gains:**
- Empowerment to identify and solve customer problems
- Accountability to business outcomes

**Changes:**
- Work collaboratively (not sequential silos)

---

## Common Transformation Obstacles

### Pilot Team Resistance

- Time pressure and delivery constraints
- Discomfort with new ways of working
- Skepticism that changes will succeed

### Leader/Stakeholder Resistance

- Attachment to favorite solutions despite outcomes
- Reluctance to relinquish control
- Expectations that teams require constant approval

---

## Scaling Considerations

**Timeline:** Years, not months

**Before scaling:**
- Address recurring problems from pilots
- Don't roll out until pilot issues resolved

**Success indicators:**
- ✓ Funding outcomes (not projects)
- ✓ Empowered teams solving problems (not building features)
- ✓ Measurable improvement in defined outcomes

**Universality:** Works across company sizes and regulated industries (tailored to context)

## Summary

### The Three Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Outcome Focus** | Impact over deliverables |
| **Continuous Discovery** | Weekly customer touchpoints |
| **Cross-Functional Collaboration** | Product trios from inception |

### Key Transformations

| Role | From | To |
|------|------|-----|
| **CEO** | Status quo | Committed to new model |
| **Product Leadership** | Directive | Coaching |
| **Product Teams** | Feature factories | Problem solvers |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Outcomes over output** — Measure impact, not shipped features
2. **Pilot first** — Don't transform organization-wide
3. **Select right teams** — Growth mindset + collaboration ability
4. **Takes years** — Not a quick fix
5. **Role changes required** — CEO, leadership, and teams all transform
6. **Expect resistance** — From teams and stakeholders
7. **Address pilots first** — Fix recurring issues before scaling
