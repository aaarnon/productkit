## Purpose

A Product Alignment Document captures the outcomes of product discoveries and retrospectives. It evolves through three sections over the product lifecycle, from discovery to launch.

---

## Phase 1: Opportunity Framing

Every product development effort begins with identifying a problem to solve or an opportunity to pursue.

**Focus:** Define the problem/opportunity without diving into detailed designs or implementation. Explore all possible solution directions.

### Sections

| Section | Guiding Questions |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Problem statement** | • What problem are we solving?<br>• What is the opportunity we are addressing? |
| **Audience** | • For whom are we solving this problem? |
| **Rationale** | • How do we know this is the right problem to solve?<br>• Does this relate to current OKRs? Which ones?<br>• Or is this a proposal for future OKRs (based on business strategy)?<br>• Will this neutralize competition? Differentiate? Delight prospective users?<br>• Any links to customer research, conversations, or data observations? |
| **Success metrics** | • How do we know if we solved this problem? |
| **Competitive research** | • How did others capture this opportunity / solve this problem? |
| **Potential solution directions** | • What are high-level solution directions to explore?<br>• Describe through short descriptions or high-level sketches / low-fi prototypes (no implementation details).<br>• Compare solution directions (e.g., impact vs complexity using T-shirt sizing: days, weeks, months). |

---

## Phase 2: Solution Framing

Team selects the most viable solution and dives into detailed solution discovery.

**Focus:** Define the solution and scope, explain why other options were not chosen, identify dependencies, assess risks, outline GTM plan.

### Sections

| Section | Guiding Questions |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Proposed solution** | • What is the scope of the proposed solution?<br>• What are the key features?<br>• How difficult will it be to realize the solution? |
| **Why proposed solutions were rejected** | • Provide context for why this solution was chosen over others.<br>• Include links to user research, customer data, etc. |
| **Out of scope** | • What is NOT in the scope of the proposed solution? |
| **Dependencies, risks, and mitigating factors** | • What are the dependencies?<br>• What are the risks? (compliance, legal, privacy, security, strategic, operational, infrastructure stability/scaling)<br>• What are the mitigating factors? |
| **GTM strategy** | • What is the release plan? Key milestones (dev complete, alpha, beta, GA, etc.)<br>• What marketing and operational support is needed?<br>• What are the pricing and packaging strategies? |

## Phase 3: Expected Outcome

The goal of the alignment meeting is to get to one of these outcomes:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **1. Looks great, please proceed** | Approved without changes |
| **2. Approved, please account for recommended course corrections** | Approved with minor adjustments |
| **3. Directionally OK, but please follow up before proceeding** | Needs additional validation |
| **4. Not approved, additional work required** | Rejected, go back to discovery |

## Usage Across Agents

This template can be used by:

| Agent | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **Discovery** | Document validated opportunities after research |
| **Roadmap** | Create initiative one-pagers (bet artifacts) |
| **Alignment** | Stakeholder alignment meetings |
| **Strategy** | Strategic bet documentation |

## Summary

### Three Phases

```
Opportunity Framing (Discovery)
    ↓
Solution Framing (Definition)
    ↓
Expected Outcome (Decision)
```

### Key Components

**Phase 1 (Opportunity):**
- Problem + Audience + Rationale
- Success metrics
- Competitive research
- Solution directions (high-level)

**Phase 2 (Solution):**
- Proposed solution + Scope
- Rejected alternatives + Rationale
- Dependencies + Risks + Mitigations
- GTM strategy

**Phase 3 (Outcome):**
- 4 decision paths

### Key Takeaways

1. **Evolves over time** — Document grows from opportunity to solution to decision
2. **Links to OKRs** — Always connect to strategic objectives
3. **Competitive context** — Understand how others approached this
4. **Clear decisions** — 4 explicit outcome paths
5. **Multi-agent use** — Same template across Discovery, Roadmap, Alignment, Strategy
