## 1. Defining Product Vision

### The Necessity of Vision

A vision is mandatory regardless of level (Junior PM to Executive). Without it, the team is like a pilot flying without a destination, hoping to hit a metric without a clear endpoint.

### Vision vs. Mission

| Concept | Definition | Analogy (Mount Everest) | Uber Example |
|---------|------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Vision** | A description of the destination—the "picture" of the future state once the goal is achieved | Standing on the summit, describing the view of the Himalayas and being above the clouds | A world with continuous trips where cities don't need parking spaces (currently 25% of cities), freeing space for parks and housing |
| **Mission** | The purpose or the "why" you are doing it, and the principles guiding the journey | Proving the team is capable of the climb and ensuring everyone survives | Transportation as reliable as running water |

### Four Core Elements of a Good Vision

1. **Lofty:** Must be exciting and slightly scary. Should motivate you to get out of bed.
2. **Realistic/Attainable:** Cannot be so "pie in the sky" that it feels impossible.
3. **Vacuum of Limitations:** Must ignore current technological or resource limitations. Assumes a time-travel scenario where you look back at what needs to be fixed to get there.
4. **Grounded in a Problem:** Must be rooted in a clear, potent user problem.

### So What?

Create a specific, descriptive image of the future state that exists independently of current constraints. Distinguish this clearly from the company mission statement. Ensure the vision is grounded in a user problem but ambitious enough to inspire fear and excitement.

**Trade-off:** The vision must balance being "lofty" (inspirational) with being "attainable" (realistic); leaning too far into lofty makes it a fantasy (e.g., Mars colonization feels impossible to some), while leaning too far into attainable makes it uninspiring (e.g., "a computer on every desk" was once lofty, now mundane).

## 2. Frameworks for Communicating Vision

### Method 1: The "Once Upon a Time" (Mad Libs) Framework

A simple storytelling structure to articulate the shift in the world.

**The Template:**
> "Once upon a time [current state/problem]. Then one day [the change/launch, e.g., in 2026]. And because of that [impact 1]. And because of that [impact 2]. And finally [the lasting dent in the universe]."

**Example (YouTube Shorts):**
> Once upon a time, YouTube was for fun cat videos. Then it became polished, discouraging casual creators. One day we launched Shorts. Because of that, anyone could express themselves, bringing back the joy of YouTube.

### Method 2: The "Future Article" Headline

Write the headline of the article you want to see when the product succeeds. Treat it like a TechCrunch or New York Times announcement.

**Include:**
- The headline
- The sub-headline (specific launch details)
- Potentially the full article to force clarity on the "pain killer" being solved

**Example:** "Uber is now replacing your Clipper card"

### Method 3: The Visual Mockup (The "Marquee Mock")

Visuals often bridge the gap better than words. This does not require a designer; PMs can sketch or use rectangles.

**Tactics:**
- **App Store Screenshot:** Draw the 3-4 rounded rectangles that would appear in the App Store. What are the key features and value props highlighted to a new user?
- **The Sketch:** Draw the physical interaction. E.g., A sketch of a person paying with cash at a Bodega to top up an Uber account helped visualize a complex financial product.

### Method 4: Elevator Pitch / Sanity Check

A short statement that should be possible to deliver in the time span of an elevator ride (approximately thirty seconds) and make the listener go "whoa" or at least "I would love to learn more". Also an important tool for product development. Revisit often to sanity check and keep alignment.

**The Template:**
> For **[target user]**, who **[user need]**, **[product name]** is a **[market category]** that **[single key benefit]**. Unlike **[competitor]**, we **[unique differentiator]**.

#### Template Components

| # | Component | Question to Answer |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 01 | Target user/customer | Who are we talking to? Who is the audience? Include psychographics in addition to sociodemographics. |
| 02 | Problem/pain point/need | What user problem does the product solve? Written from user perspective, not corporate perspective. |
| 03 | Product name | What is it called? Is it memorable? Pronounceable? International? |
| 04 | Market category | Under which category of products does this belong? |
| 05 | Single key benefit | What is the single-minded key benefit? Must be strong enough to overcome the problem. Why is it believable? |
| 06 | Competition | Who or what is the competition? Products, services, and companies. |
| 07 | Unique differentiator | What makes the product or business unique? What makes it stand out? |

#### Bonus Components

| # | Component | Question to Answer |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 08 | Source of business | What is the specific source from which growth is generated? What makes it sustainable? |
| 09 | Metrics | How can we measure success? What is the criteria for determining a positive outcome? |

#### Examples

**Gmail (April 2004)**
> For **Google users**, who **get a ton of mail**, **Gmail** is a **free webmail service** that **lets you search rather than sort**. Unlike **Hotmail**, we **give you 1GB of storage so you never have to delete a message again**.

**Pantene Pro V**
> For **females aged 25-35**, who **need confidence and a look-at-me feeling**, **Pantene Pro V** is a **hair care shampoo** that **gives you smooth hair and a fresh scent**. Unlike **Sunsilk and Dove**, it **contains a unique vitamin formula**.

**Harley Davidson (2014)**
> For **macho guys (and "macho wannabes") mostly in the US**, who **want to join a gang of cowboys**, **Harley Davidson** is a **motorcycle manufacturer** that **provides a sense of escape, personal freedom and a strong and exclusive community**. Unlike **Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki**, it **makes big, loud motorcycles**.

**Amazon**
> For **world wide web users who enjoy books**, **Amazon** is a **retail bookseller** that **provides instant access to over 1.1 million books**. Unlike **traditional book retailers**, it **provides a combination of extraordinary convenience, low prices and comprehensive selection**.

**Nest**
> For **upper-middle class homeowners who spend a lot of money on energy and heating/cooling**, **Nest** is a **thermostat** that **saves money by improving the efficiency of existing systems**. Unlike **manufacturer-provided systems**, it **learns and intelligently adapts to the inhabitants, increasing their comfort**.

### So What?

Do not rely on slide decks with bullet points to convey vision. Produce a narrative artifact: a story script, a mock press headline, a visual sketch of the future interface, or an elevator pitch statement.

**Trade-off:** High-fidelity mocks are persuasive but resource-intensive; however, using "lack of resources" is an invalid excuse. Low-fidelity sketches or "App Store" mockups are sufficient to convey the narrative and often invite helpful collaboration rather than critique of pixel-perfection.

## 3. The Process of Developing Vision

### Phase 1: Empathize (The "Understand Work")

**Dog-fooding & Cat-fooding:** Use your own product (dog-fooding) and competitor products (cat-fooding) extensively to build intuition.

**"10 Things You Should Know" Doc:**
- A living document where the team lists the top 10 quantitative or qualitative problems, including tech debt
- Gather input from cross-functional partners (marketing, data, engineering) asking them for their "top 10 things"
- **Tactical execution:** Print these problems on cards and have the team vote on the most painful ones during strategy sessions

### Phase 2: Create (The Strategy Session)

Ideally a 3-day workshop:

| Day | Focus | Activities |
|-----|-------|------------|
| Day 1 | Insights | Deep dive into the "10 things," app teardowns, and understanding the problem |
| Day 2 | Strategy | Deciding which problems to focus on and the approach |
| Day 3 | Big Rocks | Defining the major initiatives (not a laundry list) |

### Phase 3: Evangelize

**Concentric Circles of Buy-in:**

1. **Core Team:** The people building it must believe in the destination to get on the boat
2. **Stakeholders:** Partner teams (marketing, support) who provide feedback on feasibility and impact (e.g., support tickets blowing up)
3. **Leadership:** Presenting the refined vision to executives

### So What?

Establish a recurring "Top 10 Problems" document immediately to continuously capture insights. Schedule a dedicated multi-day session to synthesize these into a strategy. Systematically present the output to the immediate team first, then stakeholders, then leadership, incorporating feedback at each layer.

**Trade-off:** This process requires significant time ("patience") and "white space" away from daily execution. The trade-off is velocity now for velocity later—without this alignment, teams waste cycles on low-impact work or misaligned goals.

## 4. The Craft of Product Management: Clarity and Conviction

### Clarity

The ability to sift out noise and provide transparency on the problem and solution.

**The Narrative Document:** Instead of decks, write a 2-4 page document outlining:
- **Insights** (Data/Problem)
- **Strategy/Approach** (How we solve it)
- **Big Rocks** (3-5 major memorable initiatives)

**The "Cocktail" Metaphor:** Put the "big rocks" (ice) in first, then the liquid (sand/small tasks). If you do it the other way, it makes a mess.

### Conviction

Conviction is a "feeling" or "product sense" of what is right, not 100% data certainty.

- If a PM has 5 priorities, they lack conviction. They must be able to choose the *one* thing to build if resources were cut.
- **Stress Testing:** If a team presents Option A vs. Option B, ask "If you were the decision maker, which one would you pick?" forcing them to do the work to find their stance.

### So What?

Replace long roadmaps and slide decks with a brief (2-page) evergreen "Narrative" document. Force prioritization by limiting major initiatives to 3-5 "Big Rocks." Make a definitive choice on direction even without perfect data; if the choice feels uncomfortable, do the specific work needed to mitigate that specific risk rather than deferring the decision.

**Trade-off:** Conviction carries the risk of being wrong. However, "peanut buttering" resources across too many options to avoid risk guarantees mediocrity.

## 5. Culture and Leadership

### Company Culture Impact

| Company | Culture | Characteristics |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Uber** | "Boardroom to streets" | Highly autonomous, "toe-stepping" culture where results mattered. Allowed aggressive localization (e.g., cash payments in Nigeria despite CEO opposition) |
| **Netflix** | "Freedom and Responsibility" | Highly aligned, loosely coupled. Decisions debated in writing, but the "informed captain" makes the final call |
| **Google** | "Respect the user" | Collection of micro-cultures (Search differs from YouTube vs. Cloud). Allows flexibility but can lack singular definition |

### Team Leadership ("BEM" Vibes)

**Vulnerability as Strength:** A leader does not need to be "liked"—they should aim to be "loved."

**Definition of Love:** "The choice to extend yourself for the spiritual growth of oneself or another."

**The Difference:** Being "nice" is superficial. Being "loving" means giving raw, hard feedback because you genuinely care about the person's growth.

**Tactical Care:** Use team distros (e.g., `+PRD` email alias) to get early feedback on work, creating a safety net where the team supports each other's success.

### So What?

Define the team's decision-making protocols explicitly (e.g., who is the "informed captain"). Shift the management style from "being nice" to "extending yourself"—focus on delivering candid, constructive feedback aimed at growth, provided the recipient knows you care about them as a human.

**Trade-off:** High-autonomy cultures (like Uber/Netflix) risk chaos or "toe-stepping" if not grounded in clear principles, whereas consensus-heavy cultures risk slow decision-making. The "Love" approach risks short-term discomfort for long-term growth.
