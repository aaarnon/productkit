## Core Insight

Frameworks are tools for sensemaking, not rigid prescriptions. They fail when treated as one-size-fits-all solutions. Adaptation demonstrates mastery, not weakness.

> "Frameworks are a great starting point, means to structuring thinking, and learning tool — but the learning comes from understanding when and why to deviate."

## Why Frameworks Fail

| Failure Mode | What Happens |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Treated as blueprints** | Teams follow steps without understanding why |
| **Context ignored** | Framework designed for different situation |
| **Forced fit** | Problems squeezed into predetermined structures |
| **Multiple incomplete frameworks** | Jumping between frameworks without mastering any |
| **Obscures rather than clarifies** | Framework adds complexity instead of clarity |

---

## When to Adapt Frameworks

Adaptation is necessary when:

1. **Context differs** — Your situation differs from where the framework was created
2. **Workflow misalignment** — Initial use reveals friction with how your team works
3. **Combining frameworks** — Complex problems need elements from multiple approaches
4. **Bottom-up conflicts** — Experimentation reveals the framework's assumptions are wrong

## Warning Signs: Framework Doesn't Fit

| Sign | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| Forcing problems into structure | Framework is constraining, not enabling |
| Team resists using it | Doesn't match their mental model |
| Creates more questions than answers | Wrong level of abstraction |
| Outputs feel artificial | Checking boxes, not solving problems |
| Obscures relationships | Business, product, customer outcomes unclear |

## How to Break Frameworks Wisely

### Step 1: Understand the Original Intent

Before breaking, understand:
- What problem was this framework designed to solve?
- What context was it created for?
- What assumptions does it make?

### Step 2: Identify the Mismatch

Ask:
- How does my context differ?
- What's working in this framework?
- What isn't working?
- What's missing?

### Step 3: Adapt Deliberately

- Keep what works
- Modify what doesn't
- Add what's missing
- Remove what's unnecessary

### Step 4: Document Your Adaptation

- Why did you change it?
- What did you learn?
- When would original work better?

## The Lattice Approach

> Treat frameworks as "latticework of mental models" rather than blueprints.

**What this means:**
- Build a collection of frameworks
- Understand when each applies
- Combine elements as needed
- Let context drive selection

**Examples:**

| Situation | Frameworks to Combine |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Strategy + Prioritization | DHM + VEUC |
| Discovery + Roadmap | OST + Now-Next-Later |
| Metrics + Alignment | Impact Model + OKRs |

## Framework Maturity Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Novice** | Follows framework exactly |
| **Practitioner** | Understands when to use which framework |
| **Expert** | Adapts frameworks to context |
| **Master** | Creates new frameworks or combinations |

**Goal:** Move from "following" to "adapting" to "creating."

## Questions to Ask Before Using Any Framework

1. What problem does this framework solve?
2. What context was it designed for?
3. How similar is my context?
4. What assumptions does it make?
5. What might I need to adapt?

---

## Implications for This System

**For all agents:**
- Present frameworks as starting points, not gospel
- Acknowledge when context might require adaptation
- Offer alternatives when a framework doesn't fit
- Help users understand the "why" behind frameworks

**For Orchestrator:**
- User's context determines which frameworks apply
- Pre-PMF company needs different frameworks than Series B
- Don't force frameworks that don't fit

**For users:**
- It's okay to modify frameworks
- Understanding "why" matters more than following steps
- Your context is unique — adapt accordingly

## Quick Reference

```
When using any framework:

1. UNDERSTAND → What problem does it solve?
2. ASSESS → Does my context match?
3. TRY → Use it as starting point
4. EVALUATE → What's working? What isn't?
5. ADAPT → Modify for your context
6. LEARN → Document what you changed and why
```
