## Overview

A key challenge for the Head of Product at a fast-growing startup is focusing on product strategy to enable fast decisions and then passing on learnings across the organization as it grows. The quarterly product strategy meeting solves this—a highly leveraged technique to help teams develop into world-class product organizations.

## The Value of Quarterly Product Strategy Meetings

### Goals

- Provide context through product strategy, tactics, and metrics
- Ensure alignment across the entire product organization
- Share critical results and learnings
- Articulate theories and hypotheses for future experiments
- Determine what areas to invest in—or not—depending on results

### Guiding Principles (Netflix Culture)

- **Use CEO-level communication** — don't dumb it down for newbies
- **Engage in lively debate**
- **Don't "pretty up" slides** — meeting is about crisply articulating strategy, not showing off
- **Limit attendance** — becomes less effective with more than 20 people
- **It's NOT a decision-making meeting** — if you have successful AB test results, launch before the meeting. The forum encourages fast-paced decision-making, not slows it down

### Indirect Results at Netflix

1. **Results-focused organization** — Areas that moved metrics got more resources
2. **Leadership evaluation** — Revealed which product leaders were strong and whose skills weren't scaling
3. **Cultural impact** — Direct effect on product organization and company culture

## Meeting Structure

### 1. Start with Strategy (30 minutes)

The most important job of a product leader is to outline a cohesive product strategy with metrics and tactics.

**Product leader's job:** Delighting customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways (DHM model)

#### GLEe Model for Long-Term Vision

Netflix example:
1. **G**et big on DVD
2. **L**ead streaming
3. **E**xpand worldwide

> "Every successful company rides the growth wave until it crests and falls. The secret is to create the next growth wave before the first one collapses." — Jeff Kagan

#### Strategy-Metric-Tactic Alignment

Netflix Overall Product Strategy (circa 2007):

| Key Strategy | Tactics | Metrics |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Personalized** | Ratings Wizard, Netflix Prize | % customers rating ≥ 50 titles at 6 weeks; RMSE |
| **Instant** | Hub expansion, streaming | % disks delivered in 1 day; % watching ≥ 15 min/month |
| **Margin-enhancing** | Previously viewed, advertising, price testing | Gross margin, LTV |
| **Easy** | Simplify and kill; Progressive disclosure | % customers with ≥ 3 titles in queue day one |

**High-level engagement metric:** Monthly retention (went from 10% cancelation → 5% → 2%)

**Key tactic:** "Lather, rinse, repeat" — constantly re-articulate product strategies as the company grows. If product leaders can't remember the strategy, it's a leadership failure.

### 2. Organize Product Teams into Swim Lanes

Break down organizations into smaller teams. Each product leader:
- Owns one key metric ("the one they will move")
- Defines strategies, tactics, hypotheses, and tests to move this metric
- Has a "pod" with engineering, design, and data partners

Netflix Swim Lanes (circa 2007):
1. Personalization
2. Merchandising
3. Search
4. DVDs
5. Streaming
6. TV systems
7. Social
8. Open APIs
9. Help & Account
10. Non-member

#### One-Pagers for Each Swim Lane

Example: Netflix Personalization Strategy (2007)

| Strategy | Tactics | Metrics |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Explicit data** | Ratings wizard | % members rating ≥ 50 titles at 6 weeks |
| **Implicit data** | Browse, search & streaming data | RMSE; % members watching ≥ 15 min |
| **Matching algorithms** | Collaborative filtering, category interest | RMSE |
| **Presentation layer** | Rows, context, "walla walla" | % Queue adds ≥ 6 month; % watching ≥ 15 min/month |

## Making the Meeting Work

### Attendees

Managing attendees is like debating a wedding guest list. Too many people diminish fast-paced discussion.

**Typically in the room:**
- CEO
- Head of Product (runs the meeting)
- Product leader for each major swim lane
- Research/consumer insights leader
- Data leader
- Design leader
- Technology leader
- Tech and design partners from critical swim lanes

**On executive team:** Handle case-by-case. Inviting entire exec team leads to consensus-based approach. Goal is **tightly aligned, loosely coupled** teams.

### Advance Work

- Product leaders publish work **day before** meeting (Google Docs/Slides)
- All participants read materials in advance and comment online
- At meeting, product leaders present subset informed by comments
- **Half time for presentation, half for discussion and debate**
- No room for bystanders — all expected to participate aggressively

### Pre-Work Content

Each swim lane shares:
- One-pager (strategies, tactics, metrics)
- Key results and learnings
- Future theories and hypotheses
- Critical roadblocks or dependencies
- Data-rich and design-rich materials

### Agenda Template

**Intro by Head of Product (30 min)**
- Why we're here (articulating meeting goals)
- Overall product strategy, metrics, and tactics
- Key issues to focus on today
- Rolling four-quarter product plan by swim lane

**Qualitative/Quantitative Research and Insights (30 min)**
- "Results That Matter" — cumulative list of positive test results over the year
- High-level research or learnings across multiple lanes

**Individual Swim Lanes**
- Each product leader presents ~half time, leads discussion ~half time
- Non-critical product areas at end (buffer for time management)
- Not every area presented each quarter

**So-What's and Go-Do's (30-60 min)**
- Running list of open issues during meeting
- Outline next steps and timing

### After the Meeting

- Team dinner and beer — builds teamwork
- NPS survey for the meeting (typical NPS for productive meeting: 40s)
- Share key results at future company meetings
- Share subset at next board meeting

## What Success Looks Like

### Signs of a Good Meeting

- Intense preparation and engagement before the meeting
- Product leaders stay focused on key hypotheses (strategies)
- Work is data-rich and design-rich, shown through customers' eyes
- Product leaders don't share everything—stay focused on what matters
- Successful AND failed tests seen as learning opportunities
- **Mix of optimization (75%) and innovation/big bets (25%)**
- Open debate — no political sidebar conversations
- "Diving catches" — unplanned cross-team dependencies (sign of teams moving fast)
- Over time, teams "lengthen their stride" — more tests, more learning, more risk-taking

### The Optimization vs. Innovation Balance

Without teasing out this balance, most teams focus too much on optimization and too little on big bets:
- **Optimization:** Tests that move key metrics by 5-20%
- **Innovation:** Things that can potentially 2x, 10x, or 100x performance

Product leaders need encouragement to take on higher risk for higher potential reward.

### Signs of a Bad Meeting

- Wrong people in the room
- Too many people
- Lack of focus on data and metrics
- Devolves into PowerPoint beauty shows
- Too many political sidebar conversations

## Key Insights

### Tightly Aligned, Loosely Coupled

- **High-level alignment** against overall strategy
- **Leaders don't need to consult** multiple groups for every decision
- **Play your position** — don't meddle in other leaders' areas

### Strategy Enables Saying "No"

> "The main benefit of strategy is defining what you won't do. We can do anything, we just can't do everything."

### Focus on "What" Not Just "How"

Companies get too engaged in "how we build stuff." The quarterly meeting focuses on **"what we will build"** — defined by strategy and measured by metrics.
