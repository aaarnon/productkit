## Introduction

The classic image of product management blends discovery and agile development to incrementally build innovative new products. However, the reality is that Silicon Valley start-ups and tech giants, including Google, Stripe, and Booking.com spend a significant amount of time working on top-down, strategic initiatives, alongside these more exploratory and innovative bets.

This is not a betrayal of modern product principles, but rather the practical consequence that the biggest bets that a company can make often involve the coordination of multiple teams, and as a result require central leadership. Beyond that, for many large projects, risk is low or difficult to mitigate without shipping. That makes shipping fast and efficiently the best way to reduce risk and create value.

These top-down deliverables, often referred to as **Red Phases**, **JFDIs** (Just F*cking Do It), or **strategic projects** include things like:
- Rebranding
- Complying with new legal requirements
- Integrating a new SaaS provider (CRM, payments, etc.)
- "Big bets" that require central coordination of multiple teams (e.g. launching a new business model or service)

As a result, PMs will switch between agile innovation and more waterfall-like delivery from quarter-to-quarter and depending on the task at hand.

## Blue Phases (Innovation) vs. Red Phases (Delivery)

Product Managers broadly create value in two ways: blue phases and red phases.

### Blue Phases

These are **innovation phases**. You work more autonomously, and are on the hook for results. It's your responsibility to figure out what needs to be built to create value, and understanding the problem you're trying to solve is most of the battle. Here you need to emphasize discovery, and how you are managing the uncertainty you face.

**Success at the team level means delivering an outcome:**
- Increase customer acquisition by 20%
- Grow conversion rate by 12%
- Reduce monthly churn 10%

The outcome is clear, but the solution is unknown. The team is empowered to work through the problem space, and accountable for achieving the desired results.

**Effort distribution in Blue Phases:**
- ~80% on Problem space (Discover, Define)
- ~20% on Solution space (Design, Deliver)

### Red Phases

These are **delivery phases**, such as when you're working on a big strategic project. A high level decision has been made to build a particular solution, and there's conviction across the business in its ability to drive outcomes.

**This often happens because:**
- Leadership wants to commit to a big bet that spans across multiple disciplines and teams
- The company wants to develop industry-standard features or capabilities (low risk)

**Examples of Red Phase triggers:**
- Launching a new business model
- Changing the value proposition
- Rebranding the product
- Integrating a new CRM or payments provider
- Adding social sign-in
- Switching customer service tooling

**Success at the team level is defined as delivering an output.** Your job is not to second guess the decision to embark on the project, or gather more evidence to support it. The decision has been made, and it's time to make it happen. You need to deliver certainty around scope and timelines.

**Effort distribution in Red Phases:**
- ~20% on Problem space
- ~80% on Solution space (Design, Deliver, Live)

### Recognising the Right Phase

**It's important to understand which phase you're in because the behaviors that lead to success in one phase result in failure in the other.**

- Using red phase tactics in a blue phase will look like a spectacular lack of vision and ambition.
- Using blue phase tactics in a red phase will look egotistical, obstructive and like you don't understand the bigger picture.

## Case Study: Booking.com – Ryanair Integration

Booking.com partnered with Ryanair to become their preferred car hire supplier, worth over 2 million incremental bookings.

The commercial opportunity and decision was passed down to the product teams, with them empowered to implement as they see fit – as long as they hit a **4 month deadline**.

**Decisions the teams needed to make:**
- How scalable could the solution be for potential future partners?
- What would be the best way to integrate and de-risk the delivery date?
- What really was required for a successful launch, and which features could come later?
- What were the legal, commercial and process considerations?

This required a huge team effort, spanning **over 20 different teams**. It required upfront planning, trade-off decisions, de-risking conversations, weekly stand-ups and accountability, cross-functional coordination.

**Result:** The teams launched on time, brought in millions of incremental bookings and delivered incredible technology upgrades.

## Red Phases vs. Feature Factory

Red phases are NOT the same as working in a feature factory:
- **Red phases:** One-off projects which have already been derisked
- **Feature factories:** Top-down management is the standard way of delivering features; roadmap is poorly supported by discovery

Another way to think of this: red phases are like a senior leader acting as PM for a team of teams – derisking through discovery is still being done. But in feature factories, product work is often devoid of discovery and output focused, rather than results focused.

## Benefits of Red Phases

### Organizational Benefits:
- **Facilitate "big bets"** – Allow companies to tackle large, cross-functional initiatives
- **Reduce risk** – Most effective when biggest risks are time to value and opportunity cost, rather than value and usability

### Personal Benefits:
- **Makes you better at execution** – Becoming expert in delivering change effectively
- **Looks incredible on your CV** – Tangible outcomes with large revenue numbers
- **Develops your executive skills** – C-Suite members need ability to deliver large, cross-functional projects (changing business model, rebranding, M&A)

## How to Excel at Red Phases

The success of a red phase is based on shipping a high quality solution on time and on budget. Focus on five areas:

### 1. Clear Deadline

A credible deadline creates urgency and focus, prevents scope creep. Leaders typically know their "appetite" for a project.

**Deadlines can be:**
- **Internally-driven:** Based on high-level estimate
- **Externally-driven:** Partner dependency, legal obligation

**With a deadline in place:** Fix the timeline and allow scope to vary. Instead of "how long will this take?" ask: "what can you build in this time?"

**Deadlines are most effective when they:**
- Seem credible to all teams involved
- Are communicated across the whole business
- Plastered on every stand-up board, document and communication channel
- Referred to daily

### 2. Create a Feasible Plan

Four phases to create a plan:

#### Phase 1 – Kick Off
- Make sure everyone is clear on objectives and context
- Identify the big blocks of work

**Briefing from project sponsor should cover:**
- **Name** – What are we calling this project?
- **Objective** – What does success look like?
- **Why** – Why is this important? How does it link to company objectives?
- **Context** – What else is going on (market, competition, funding cycle)?
- **Timeline** – What deadline or appetite do we have?
- **Constraints** – What are we working within?
- **Team** – Who is doing what? Who is the main decision maker?
- **Approach** – How we expect to tackle this?

#### Phase 2 – Agreeing Scope
Use **MoSCoW** prioritization:
- **Must have**
- **Should have**
- **Could have**
- **Won't have**

Map delivery onto a **Gantt chart** to track progress, visualize dependencies, and forecast.

#### Phase 3 – Understanding Risks
Before diving into discovery, understand:
- Which risks you are responsible for mitigating
- How much risk appetite the project sponsor has

**Tactics:**
- **Identify and tackle biggest risks first** – e.g., Booking.com created a skeleton API with dummy data early to de-risk the Ryanair integration
- **Pre-mortems** – Ask: "If this project fails, why would that have been?"

#### Phase 4 – Launch Planning
Work with other functions (customer success, sales, marketing) to ensure all teams are set up for launch:
- Briefing customer services and sales teams with a launch document
- Writing internal FAQs
- Internal demos ahead of launch
- Collaborating with sales & marketing to update materials
- Coordinating launch plan with marketing teams
- Working with customer success on comms plans

### 3. Accurate Forecast

Monitor whether you're on track regularly. Extrapolate current rate of work and see if you're on target.

**Critical insight:** You can only take action if there is still time. If you're 3 days behind schedule 2 weeks before deadline, there's a chance to recover. If you realize on launch day, you're 3 days late.

#### Case Study: FutureLearn
In 2020, FutureLearn launched a new business model involving 5 product teams over 4.5 months. Two months in, the payments team was falling behind.

Because the problem was spotted early (2.5 months before deadline), the team found a solution: with 2 additional senior engineers, they could split into 4 mini-teams working in parallel. Leadership reassigned engineers from less critical initiatives, and the project shipped early.

### 4. Course Correct

When you identify you're off track, work out the best options:

- **Reducing the scope** – Cut scope to hit deadline with same team
- **Increasing the team size** – Bring in additional people or contractors
- **Pushing the deadline back** – Last resort; negative impact on credibility
- **Reallocating team members** – Change team lead or key members
- **Escalate the problem** – People higher up have visibility and avenues you don't

### 5. Communicate

#### Within the Project Team:

**Digital channels:**
- Create messaging channels (Slack, email lists)
- Spaces for documentation (Notion, Monday.com, Google Docs)

**Status meetings:**
- Keep project front of mind
- Remind people of deadlines and dependencies
- Create social pressure to deliver

Format: What have they done, what are they doing next, what blockers do they need help with?

**Decision Logs:**
- Document decisions made
- Prevent same conversations repeating
- Columns: Question raised, Decision made, Rationale, Decider, Date

**War Rooms:**
- Bring essential people together physically
- Everyone working on project in close proximity
- Further away from people NOT on project who might distract them

#### Across the Wider Organization:

**Review meetings:**
- High-level updates to project sponsors and senior stakeholders
- Is project on track? Any changes? Any asks?
- Use RAG (Red/Amber/Green) statuses with clear definitions
- Send pre-reads and summaries

**Sharing sessions:**
- Open to anyone interested, recorded
- Celebrate work, raise morale
- Opportunity for questions, context on updates

**Written updates (weekly):**
- Status – on track or not
- Progress – what got done
- Next steps – what needs to happen
- Changes – key decisions or changes to plan
- Insights – new information discovered
- Risks – major risks to success or timeline
- Mitigations – what you're doing about risks

## Summary

Full stack PMs need to manage the basics of project management. This allows them to deliver large, complex projects on time and on budget.

**Good project management comes down to doing the basics well:**
1. Having a deadline
2. Creating a plan
3. Tracking progress
4. Taking prompt action to course correct
5. Keeping everyone up to date

Mastering these techniques allows PMs to deliver impact in a wide range of situations, gives them strong case studies for their CVs, and is critical for those aspiring to executive positions.
