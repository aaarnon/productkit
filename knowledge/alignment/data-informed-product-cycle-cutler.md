## Overview

A cyclical approach to data-informed product development that bridges the gap between high-level strategy and feature-level execution. Addresses the "messy middle" problem—the disconnection between business metrics and product roadmaps.

## The Core Loop

```
Strategy → Models → Metrics → Leverage Points → Bets → Learning
    ↑                                                      |
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Six Stages

### 1. Strategy

The foundation begins with clear strategic direction.

**Good strategy requires** (via Rumelt):
1. Diagnosis of the challenge
2. Guiding policy
3. Coherent actions to focus resources

---

### 2. Models

Develop context-appropriate mental models to understand the business. These abstractions help teams communicate and explain systems effectively.

**Examples:**
- Retention lifecycle frameworks
- North Star Framework (leading indicators of sustainable growth)
- Journey maps
- Value chains
- Causal relationship diagrams

> "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

**Critical insight:** Models orient teams and enable better conversations.

### 3. Metrics and Measurement

Rather than disconnected executive dashboards, measurement should connect directly to the models.

**Key questions:**
- What parts of our model matter most?
- How do we measure them?

---

### 4. Leverage Points

Identify where small efforts produce outsized results.

**Examples:**
- Funnel stages with high drop-off
- Usability issues causing friction
- Unexplored flywheels

**Purpose:** Ensures focused energy allocation.

---

### 5. Placing Bets and Measuring Impact

Teams design solutions informed by data, then measure impact against strategy and models.

**Methods:**
- Experimentation (A/B tests)
- Observation and analysis

---

### 6. Learning Integration

The cycle closes by updating based on discoveries:
- Refine strategy
- Update models
- Adjust measurement approaches

---

## Key Problems This Addresses

| Problem | Symptom |
|---------|---------|
| **Skipping strategy** | Jump from high-level goals to features |
| **Messy middle** | Disconnect between business metrics and roadmaps |
| **Generic models** | Non-actionable frameworks that don't guide decisions |
| **Static approaches** | Failure to incorporate learning |

---

## Requirements for Success

- **Psychological safety** — Teams must feel safe to learn and adapt
- **Organizational support** — Leadership enables the cycle
- **Repeated cycling** — Sustained improvement requires continuous iteration

---

## Summary

| Stage | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Strategy** | Clear direction | Diagnosis, policy, coherent actions |
| **Models** | Understand the system | Context-appropriate frameworks |
| **Metrics** | Measure what matters | Connected dashboards |
| **Leverage Points** | Focus energy | High-impact opportunities |
| **Bets** | Design solutions | Experiments and features |
| **Learning** | Close the loop | Updated strategy and models |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Connect strategy to execution** — Don't skip the messy middle
2. **Models enable conversation** — They orient teams and guide decisions
3. **Metrics follow models** — Not disconnected dashboards
4. **Find leverage** — Small efforts, outsized results
5. **Learning closes the loop** — Update everything based on discoveries
6. **Cycle continuously** — Sustained improvement requires repetition
