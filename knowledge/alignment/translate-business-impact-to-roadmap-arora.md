## What is Impact?

**Impact** is the tangible positive effect you create on the most important goals for the company.

**In product management context:** The same definition, but limited to actions or outcomes directly attributable to the product team.

**How PMs create impact:**
1. Build only those solutions that contribute to the larger goals
2. Know how to measure the impact of the solutions
3. Know how to translate and aggregate the impact of each solution into the larger product and business goals

## The Four-Step Framework

This is not a linear process—it's a cycle that runs continuously, with the product team involved in multiple steps simultaneously.

### Framework Overview

| Level | Primary Owner | Primary Deliverable | Horizon |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Business Strategy** | Founders / CXOs | Business strategy, Business goals | 2-5 years |
| **Product Strategy** | CPO and Product Heads | Product vision, strategy, and goals | 2-5 years |
| **Product Discovery / Problem Definition** | Product Leaders (GPMs, Directors, VPs) | Set of problems prioritised by impact to goal (aka roadmap) | 6-12 months |
| **Solution Design and Delivery** | PMs, EMs, Designers, PMMs | High quality and on-time delivery of solutions | 3-12 months |

### Information Flow

**Top-Down (Planning):**
- Translate business strategy to product strategy and goals
- Identify the right users, market, competition
- Identify the most important problems that need solving

**Bottom-Up (Measurement):**
- Translate (objectively) how product strategy contributes to business strategy
- Map prioritised problems to product goals and quantify impact
- Report product metrics that measure impact created

## Step 1: Create or Understand the Business Goal

**Key principle:** Without a goal, there is no impact. Start at the highest level—understand the founder's or CEO's goal for the company.

**Best practices:**
- Capture goals in a formal document everyone can read
- Use forums (all-hands, town halls) to share thinking and approach
- Allow questions about the goals

**Time horizons:**
- Mature companies: 2-5 years
- Startups (<5 years): Shorter horizons

### Example: Food Delivery App

**Business Goal:** "Increase revenue by acquiring new customers."

## Step 2: Translate Business Goals into Product Strategy and Goals

Each department head translates business goals into team strategy within a **limited universe** defined by Step 1.

**Why a limited universe matters:**
1. Without it, heads have too vast a playing field—takes longer to develop effective strategies
2. Risk of creating strategies that don't contribute to business goals

### Example: Team Goals Derived from Business Goal

| Team | Goal |
|------|------|
| **Product** | Enhance the mobile app to make ordering food easier and more enjoyable for users |
| **Marketing** | Increase digital marketing spend, leading to more app downloads, user engagement, and brand awareness |
| **Sales** | Onboard increased number of restaurant partners on the platform |
| **Operations** | Increase delivery partners for on-time delivery; Increase efficiency of customer support |

**Who creates product strategy:**
- Product leaders who are experts in their product areas
- They understand customers, competition, market, and industry
- They are close to founders/CEO and deeply understand business goals
- Most PMs in medium-large companies have limited involvement—leaders may consult them for on-the-ground realities

## Step 3: Identify Problems and Create Roadmap

**This is where the working group (PMs, engineers, designers) gets deeply involved.**

### The Process

1. **Understand context:** Users, market, competition, strengths and weaknesses
2. **Research:** Analyse data, do user research, evaluate wins/fails, consult experts
3. **Identify problems:** Find problems that, when solved, create the most impact on product goals
4. **Sequence by impact:** Problems with largest impact go to top of list

**The roadmap = the list of sequenced problems**

### Role Overlap

| Role | Brings |
|------|--------|
| Designers | Know the users |
| Engineers | Know the technology |
| PMs | Know market, competition, business |

All work closely because everyone benefits from getting this right. Wrong or low-impact problems = less impact for everyone.

### PM Must Ensure

1. **Impact is measurable** — Define metrics that accurately measure impact
2. **Problems contribute to goals** — Solving them actually moves the needle on Step 2 goals
3. **Everyone has reviewed and agreed** — Including leaders

### Example: Identified Problems

| Problem | Data Point |
|---------|------------|
| Users find it difficult to discover new restaurants and dishes | xx% new users don't even get to a menu page |
| Many users don't understand checkout process well | xx% abandon their orders |
| Users are frustrated with inaccurate delivery estimates | xx% users have complained about this |

## Step 4: Design and Deliver the Solution

**Transition from planning to doing.** Two distinct phases:

### Phase A: Solution Design

1. **Brainstorm ideas** to solve agreed-upon problems
2. **Prioritise solutions** based on high impact and low cost-to-build
3. **Detail the solution:** PRDs, user stories, designs, wireframes, technical specs
4. **Create success criteria:** Metrics that confidently say whether solution worked

**Success metrics must:**
1. Be closely related to "impact" metrics from Step 3
2. Accurately and confidently measure solution impact
3. Translate to larger goals from Step 2

### Example: Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Difficulty discovering restaurants | "Discover" section with personalised recommendations based on preferences and past orders |
| Confusing checkout | Streamline checkout—save payment info, one-click ordering |
| Inaccurate delivery estimates | Real-time GPS tracking with accurate estimates and updates |

### Phase B: Solution Delivery

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Review | Review and agree on requirements/solution design |
| 2. Estimate | Estimate required bandwidth and time |
| 3. Acceptance criteria | Define criteria to decide if solution does intended job |
| 4. Testing | Test the solution |
| 5. Launch | Ship to users |

**Goals:**
1. Deliver solution as per agreed design
2. Deliver as per quality and timeliness standards

**Note:** Roles are much more precise at this stage with less overlap in responsibilities.

## Translating Impact Back to Business Goals (Bottom-Up)

**The critical step:** Pass correct information bottom-up so leaders objectively know the impact created.

### Example: Solution to Problem 3 (GPS Tracking)

**Solution:** Integrate real-time GPS tracking for orders

**Success metrics:**
- Metric: Total no. of complaints about inaccurate delivery times
- Success criteria: Reduce complaints by xx%

### The Translation Challenge

**Business goal:** "Increase revenue by acquiring new customers"

**Product metric:** Decrease in complaints

**Problem:** These are NOT the same thing. PM must translate product metrics to business metrics.

### Translation Approach

1. **Identify connections:**
   - Decreased complaints → happier customers → more orders (short and long term)
   - Decreased complaints → more effective CS team → handle more complaints better

2. **Create objective math:**
   - Compare revenue from new users who had complaints vs. those who didn't
   - Estimate additional orders CS team can help complete with extra time
   - Sum these numbers

3. **Report the translated impact**

**Key insight:** The math doesn't need to be 100% accurate. It can be loose—as long as it's logical and agreeable to others, it works.

## Summary: The Complete Cycle

```
BUSINESS STRATEGY (2-5 years)
    ↓ Translate to product strategy
PRODUCT STRATEGY & GOALS (2-5 years)
    ↓ Identify right problems
PROBLEM DEFINITION / ROADMAP (6-12 months)
    ↓ Design and build solutions
SOLUTION DESIGN & DELIVERY (3-12 months)
    ↑ Report product metrics
    ↑ Map problems to goals, quantify impact
    ↑ Translate product impact to business impact
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **Start with business goals** — Without goals, there's no impact
2. **Product strategy operates within a limited universe** — Defined by business goals
3. **Roadmap = sequenced list of problems** — Not features
4. **Measure impact at every level** — From solution metrics to business metrics
5. **Translation is essential** — Product metrics rarely equal business metrics directly
6. **It's a cycle, not a waterfall** — Teams operate at multiple levels simultaneously
