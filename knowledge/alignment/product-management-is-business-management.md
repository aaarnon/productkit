## TL;DR

Product Management in tech has drifted away from its business roots. It's time to re-establish the clear business connection with tech products.

**Four key principles:**
1. Product Management is Business Management
2. Product Success drives Business Success
3. Product Leaders are Business Leaders
4. Product Planning is Business Planning

## The Problem

There's been a reckoning in tech Product Management. Several events highlighted the issues:

1. **AirBnB incident** — Brian Chesky: "We got rid of the classic Product Management function"
2. **Snap layoffs** — Laid off PMs "to speed up decision making"
3. **Poolside PM video** — PM described as "help prioritize and help engineers stay on track"
4. **66% turnover** — Senior PMs looking to change jobs (Dec 2023 survey)

### The 5 Dysfunctions of PM Teams
1. Poor Job Definitions
2. Under-skilled Product Managers
3. Poor Processes
4. Unclear Objectives
5. Weak Product Leadership

**The elephant in the room:** Lack of clear, explicit connection between product work and business goals.

## 1. Product Management is Business Management

When people say "Product Management," they emphasize PRODUCT over MANAGEMENT.

**But:** Product is the modifier. The main word is MANAGEMENT.

**In CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods):** Product Management is clearly BUSINESS management — focused on markets, sales channels, and driving business success.

**In tech:** It drifted to feature & delivery management. Where is:
- Risk management?
- Cross-functional management?
- Stakeholder management?
- Financial management?
- Strategic management?
- Lifecycle management?

### The McElroy Memo (1931)

Product Management started at Proctor & Gamble with Neil McElroy. From day one, it was about business management of products.

**Action:** Explicitly align product work to business objectives. Get agreement with leadership on the connection between product plans and business goals.

## 2. Product Success Drives Business Success

Business success (revenue, profits) is driven by product success (adoption, utilization, expansion, renewal).

**But:** Too many companies don't explicitly focus on the relationship between:
- Product success (leading indicators)
- Business success (lagging indicators)

### What Business Success Really Means

> Business success is about designing a company that can repeatedly create and deliver products that maximize return and create sustainable competitive advantage.

**This requires:**
- Understanding markets, customers, competitors
- Making explicit choices (strategy)
- Positioning and differentiating for target markets

**POP QUIZ:** Can you state how your products are positioned and differentiated in the target markets you serve?

## 3. Product Leaders are Business Leaders

Product Leaders (VP, CPO, Director) MUST be business focused.

**Common problem:** In Sales-led organizations, Product is seen as a delivery organization — "deliver features that Sales sells."

### Snowflake Example

CRO Chris Degnan on how Product and Sales work together:

> "Put Product in the room with the customer to get direct feedback. It's not for me to decide the Product Roadmap. Bring the Product team to the Customer and the Product team makes the decision."

**Key insight:**
- Sales is responsible for THIS year's revenue
- Product is responsible for NEXT year's revenue

Product Leaders are business-focused but their focus is on setting the company up for ongoing future success.

## 4. Product Planning is Business Planning

Most product planning = deciding what features to build next.

**Missing:** Confidence that what gets built will drive business goals.

### Quote from VP Marketing

> "How is what Product Management presented going to get us to $XX million? Where is the big picture? It seems everything is looked at as individual products instead of as a portfolio to grow."

**Action:** Product plans MUST be tied to business plans.

**Simple change:** Start launch planning alongside product planning. Bring Marketing/Product Marketing in early to align.

## Summary: The Four Principles

| Principle | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| **PM is Business Management** | Focus on MANAGEMENT, not just PRODUCT |
| **Product Success → Business Success** | Track leading indicators that drive lagging indicators |
| **Product Leaders are Business Leaders** | Equal seat at the table with Sales, Marketing, Finance |
| **Product Planning is Business Planning** | Tie product work to explicit business objectives |

## Why This Matters for PM-Copilot

**You cannot do Product Management without understanding the business.**

This is why the Orchestrator:
1. Actively builds company context before giving advice
2. Asks about stage, business model, PMF status
3. Tailors all guidance to business context

A pre-PMF startup needs different PM approaches than a Series B company. Without business context, advice is generic and potentially harmful.
