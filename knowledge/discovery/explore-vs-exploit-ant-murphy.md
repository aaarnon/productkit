This structured document details the concepts and strategies shared by Ant Murphy, founder of Product Pathways, regarding the two modes of product discovery: **Explore** and **Exploit**.

## 1. Introduction to Product Discovery

*   **Presenter:** Ant Murphy, a product coach based in Sydney and founder of Product Pathways.
*   **Core Purpose of Discovery:** The fundamental goal of product discovery is **reducing risk**.
*   **The Mechanism:** Discovery addresses high degrees of uncertainty and unknowns by gaining information and knowledge through activities like research and user testing.
*   **Confidence Building:** These activities build confidence in an idea, validating its worth or identifying when an idea should be abandoned.
*   **Discovery vs. Delivery:** While discovery reduces risk upfront, delivery also reduces risk through iterative development, incremental releases, and staged rollouts (e.g., beta groups).

## 2. The Discovery Spectrum: Explore vs. Exploit

Discovery exists on a spectrum between two distinct challenges:

### Exploit (Optimization)

*   **Definition:** Improving and **optimising existing products** or processes.
*   **Context:** Deals with known spaces, existing users, and established technology.
*   **Risk Level:** Generally features **less risk** and a lower failure rate because the foundation is already functional.
*   **Examples:** Improving an onboarding flow, increasing engagement, or reducing churn.

### Explore (Innovation)

*   **Definition:** Investigating **new and unknown spaces** to find disruptive opportunities.
*   **Context:** High degree of unknowns, often requiring new skills or knowledge the company does not currently possess.
*   **Risk Level:** Characterised by **high uncertainty, volatility, and a high failure rate**; one might explore 100 things to find one viable idea.
*   **Examples:** Investigating AI applications (when not an AI company) or exploring international market expansion.

## 3. Methodological Differences

The activities performed in discovery look fundamentally different depending on the mode.

| Feature | Exploit Mode | Explore Mode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Finding a **scalable solution** to a specific problem. | Exploring **what is possible** in a rapid, low-fi way. |
| **Framework** | Often follows **Design Thinking** or the **Double Diamond** (Discover, Define, Ideate, Test). | May stop at identifying opportunities or feature multiple entry points. |
| **Entry Point** | Typically starts with a clear problem space. | May start with a **solution** (e.g., "What can we do with AI?") to find problems. |
| **User Interviews** | **Structured**: Validating specific assumptions with comparable data points. | **Unstructured**: Open-ended conversations that follow tangents to learn broadly. |
| **Observation** | Intent-driven (e.g., "Observe the user doing X"). | Agenda-free (e.g., "Sit with the user for a day to see what happens"). |

## 4. The Bee Analogy (Why Explore is Essential)

To illustrate the necessity of both modes, Murphy references an analogy by Rory Sutherland regarding bee behaviour:

*   **The Waggle Dance:** Bees communicate the location of flowers to the hive so others can **exploit** that food source.
*   **The "Rogue" Bees:** A percentage of bees ignore the dance and continue to **explore** randomly.
*   **The Survival Strategy:** If the known flowers die (due to drought or flood), the hive survives because the explorers find new sources.
*   **Adaptability:** Evolution has programmed bees to increase the percentage of "explorers" in more **volatile environments**.

## 5. Resource Allocation and Team Structure

*   **Time Allocation:** Most companies spend **70-80%+ on Exploit** (optimising current revenue) and **20-30% on Explore** (protecting against disruption).
*   **The Risks of Neglect:** Companies that fail to explore (e.g., Kodak or Blockbuster) remain vulnerable to "local maximums" and sudden market shifts.
*   **Team Constructs:**
    *   **Core Product Teams:** Should ideally perform both activities for their specific areas.
    *   **Dedicated Explore Teams:** Often called "Emerging Tech" or "Innovation" teams, these groups focus on spaces outside the current product remit to avoid context switching for core teams.
*   **Skill Sets:** Explore teams require **curiosity**, market analysis skills, and the ability to build "quick and dirty" prototypes rather than scalable code.
*   **Team Composition:** Ideally a lean, cross-functional "Product Trio" (PM, Designer, Engineer) or slightly larger, potentially including a **data scientist**.

## 6. Success Criteria and Metrics

*   **Measuring Exploit:** Success is quantifiable through ROI, revenue increases, or specific metric improvements like churn reduction.
*   **Measuring Explore:** Extremely **difficult to quantify upfront** due to uncertainty.
*   **Portfolio Perspective:** Explore should be viewed as a **strategic cost**—a "tax" paid to ensure the business is not disrupted. Demanding quantified ROI for exploration often prevents it from ever happening.

## 7. Practical Implementation Tips

*   **Prototyping:** In Explore mode, prototypes do not need real data or integrations; they only need to be functional enough to validate a step forward.
*   **Creating Space:**
    *   **Unshackled Hackathons:** Allow people to work on anything without a set theme.
    *   **Innovation Sprints/Days:** Carve out specific time (e.g., one day per quarter) for teams to observe customers or learn new technologies with **no agenda**.
*   **Tools:** The **Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)** is primarily an **Exploit tool** because it starts with a defined outcome and breaks it down, which doesn't fit the unstructured nature of Explore.

## Analogy for Understanding

Think of a professional chef. **Exploiting** is perfecting the signature dish that pays the bills—tweaking the seasoning to make it 5% better. **Exploring** is the chef spending a Sunday in a laboratory with liquid nitrogen and unfamiliar spices. The laboratory work might result in a mess 90% of the time, but it is the only way the chef discovers the next dish that will redefine the restaurant before the old one goes out of style.
