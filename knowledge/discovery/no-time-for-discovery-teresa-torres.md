## Overview

Teams often feel they have no time for discovery. This guide addresses the seven most common obstacles and provides practical solutions for integrating discovery into busy schedules.

---

## The Seven Obstacles

### 1. Delivery-Focused Teams

**The Problem:** Team is consumed by shipping features with no bandwidth for research.

**The Solution:**
- Start with solution-related discovery (assumption testing, not generative research)
- Delegate delivery management tasks to engineering teams
- Reclaim PM time for validation work
- Frame discovery as "de-risking delivery" not "extra work"

### 2. Stakeholder Management Overload

**The Problem:** Endless meetings to keep stakeholders informed.

**The Solution:**
- Use the same artifacts you create for work to share work
- Shift to asynchronous communication:
  - Post snapshots to Slack
  - Share opportunity trees in Notion
  - Email weekly discovery summaries
- Replace meetings with async updates where possible

### 3. Cross-Team Coordination Complexity

**The Problem:** Constant coordination meetings across teams.

**The Solution:**
- Visualize dependencies using:
  - Experience maps
  - Opportunity solution trees
  - Story maps
- Clear visualization reduces repetitive coordination meetings
- Let the artifacts do the explaining

### 4. Product Support Demands

**The Problem:** Firefighting customer issues consumes all time.

**The Solution:**
- Distinguish between two types of issues:

| Issue Type | Solution |
|------------|----------|
| **Instability** | Dedicated stabilization sprint |
| **Enablement gaps** | Better sales/support documentation |

- Bundle fixes into "pain-relieving releases"
- Address root cause, not symptoms

### 5. Meeting Overload

**The Problem:** Calendar is full of meetings with no room for discovery.

**The Solution:**
- Audit calendar obligations
- Experiment with skipping meetings
- Test whether your presence is truly necessary
- Replace in-person attendance with asynchronous updates
- Reclaim even 30 minutes/week

### 6. Organization Undervalues Discovery

**The Problem:** Leadership doesn't see discovery as valuable.

**The Solution:**
- **Don't ask permission** - just start
- Start small with one habit (weekly interviews)
- Demonstrate value through tangible business insights
- Sell outcomes, not the process
- Show how discovery prevented waste or found opportunity

### 7. Discovery Feels Inefficient

**The Problem:** Research feels slow and unproductive.

**The Solution:**
- Focus learning on unknowns most critical to outcomes
- Don't research everything—prioritize high-risk assumptions
- Invest in automation early:
  - Recruitment tools
  - Scheduling automation
  - Template systems
- Reduce setup time as team matures

## Minimum Viable Discovery

### Start Here

If you're overwhelmed, begin with just **30 minutes to 1 hour weekly** on a single habit:

| Habit | Time Required | Impact |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| One customer interview | 30-45 min | Direct customer insight |
| Assumption mapping | 30 min | Focus validation efforts |
| Opportunity review | 30 min | Maintain strategic alignment |

### Don't Try Everything

- Pick ONE habit to start
- Build consistency before adding more
- Expand gradually as capacity allows

## Discovery Time Audit

### Where to Find Time

| Activity | Time Sink | Recovery Strategy |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Status meetings | 2-4 hrs/week | Async updates instead |
| Stakeholder reports | 1-2 hrs/week | Share working artifacts |
| Coordination calls | 2-3 hrs/week | Visual dependency maps |
| Support escalations | Variable | Enablement documentation |
| Feature requests | 1-2 hrs/week | Redirect to opportunity space |

### Realistic Targets

- **Week 1-2:** Find 30 minutes
- **Week 3-4:** Build to 1 hour
- **Month 2:** Aim for 2-3 hours
- **Month 3+:** Sustainable 3-4 hours

---

## Reframing Discovery

### Discovery Is Not Extra Work

| Old Frame | New Frame |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Additional research phase" | "Risk reduction" |
| "Nice to have" | "Waste prevention" |
| "When we have time" | "Part of building" |
| "Separate from delivery" | "Integrated with delivery" |

### Making the Business Case

When leadership questions discovery time:
- Point to rework that could have been avoided
- Show features that missed the mark
- Quantify cost of building wrong things
- Share quick wins from customer insights

---

## Integration Strategies

### Weaving Discovery Into Existing Work

| Existing Activity | Discovery Integration |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Sprint planning | Review relevant snapshots |
| Backlog grooming | Check assumption confidence |
| Design reviews | Reference customer quotes |
| Retrospectives | Add "what we learned about customers" |
| Stakeholder updates | Include discovery insights |

### Making It Automatic

- Schedule recurring interview slots
- Add discovery checkbox to PR templates
- Include assumption check in definition of done
- Build into team rituals

---

## Common Excuses (And Responses)

| Excuse | Response |
|--------|----------|
| "We don't have budget for research" | Interviews with existing customers cost nothing |
| "We already know our customers" | When did you last talk to one? |
| "Engineering is waiting" | De-risking prevents rework |
| "Leadership wants features" | Features that miss the mark waste more time |
| "We'll do it after launch" | Post-launch learning is more expensive |
| "Our roadmap is set" | Discovery informs how, not just what |

## Building Organizational Support

### Start Without Permission

1. Run your first interview this week
2. Create a snapshot
3. Share one insight with team
4. Show value, don't argue for it

### Grow Through Results

1. Track what you learned
2. Document decisions informed by discovery
3. Note waste avoided
4. Share wins publicly
5. Let success build support

1. **Start with 30 minutes** - Minimum viable discovery
2. **Pick one habit** - Don't try everything at once
3. **Audit your calendar** - Find time in existing activities
4. **Use async communication** - Replace meetings with artifacts
5. **Don't ask permission** - Demonstrate value through results
6. **Automate recruitment** - Reduce friction over time
