## What Is an Interview Snapshot?

A one-page document synthesizing learnings from a single customer conversation. It captures the essential insights in a format that's easy to create, share, and reference over time.

## Why Use Snapshots?

### Problems They Solve

| Problem | How Snapshots Help |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Information overload** | Captures only essentials |
| **Insights get lost** | Documented and searchable |
| **Hard to share** | One-page format, easy to skim |
| **Time-consuming synthesis** | 15-20 minutes to create |
| **Difficult to spot patterns** | Consistent format enables comparison |
| **Team alignment** | Shared understanding of customer |

## How to Create Snapshots

### Timing
Create immediately after interviews while details remain fresh—ideally within 15-20 minutes for experienced teams.

### Process

1. **Identify key moments** from the narrative
2. **Sequence them** to recreate story structure
3. **Draw experience map** to visualize the journey
4. **Extract opportunities** (explicit needs/pain points)
5. **Note insights** (broader observations)
6. **Select memorable quote** that captures essence
7. **Add quick facts** for context

### The Power of Drawing

> "Stories are narrative... But when we capture an interview participant's story, it rarely comes out that cleanly."

Drawing the experience map forces you to:
- Clarify the narrative structure
- Identify gaps in your understanding
- Spot the critical moments
- See the journey from their perspective

## How to Use Snapshots

### Day-to-Day Applications

| Use Case | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Share with stakeholders** | Post to Slack, Notion, or shared drive |
| **Assess opportunities** | Reference when prioritizing |
| **Revisit for new work** | Find relevant past interviews |
| **Mine for opportunities** | Review when outcomes shift |

### Strategic Applications

| Use Case | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Build shared understanding** | Team reviews snapshots together |
| **Size opportunities** | Count frequency across snapshots |
| **Identify target segments** | Look for patterns in quick facts |
| **Track trends over time** | Compare snapshots chronologically |

### Reinterviewing
When targeting an opportunity, revisit relevant snapshots and consider reinterviewing those customers for updated context.

---

## Opportunities vs Insights

### Opportunities
- Directly actionable
- Clear customer need, pain point, or desire
- Can be added to opportunity space
- Examples:
  - "I need a faster way to compare options"
  - "The checkout process is confusing"
  - "I wish I could save my progress"

### Insights
- Observations worth noting
- May not be immediately actionable
- Inform future thinking
- Examples:
  - "Most participants check reviews first"
  - "Price sensitivity varies by segment"
  - "Trust is a major factor in decisions"

---

## Tools & Formats

### Recommended Tools
- **Slides:** PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides
- **Whiteboards:** Miro, FigJam, Mural
- **Documents:** Notion, Confluence

### Consistency Matters
Use the same template across all snapshots to:
- Enable easy comparison
- Build team familiarity
- Speed up creation
- Facilitate pattern recognition

---

## Best Practices

### Do
- Create immediately after interview
- Use customer's exact words for quotes
- Draw the experience map (don't skip it)
- Keep to one page
- Share widely and asynchronously
- Review snapshots as a team regularly

### Don't
- Wait days to synthesize
- Over-edit the quote
- Skip the visual map
- Add too much detail
- Keep snapshots siloed
- Treat as one-time documents
