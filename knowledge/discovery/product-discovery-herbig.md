## Overview

Product Discovery is the evidence-informed process of reducing uncertainty as you find problems worth solving and solutions worth building. It emerges through nonlinear activities conducted by cross-functional teams.

**Core insight:** Product Discovery should be mostly about the problem space, not rushing to solutions.

---

## Chapter 1: Product Discovery Fundamentals

### What Is Product Discovery?

A flexible period during which teams focus on **building the right thing** (as opposed to building the thing right during Delivery).

```

│   PROBLEM SPACE                    SOLUTION SPACE               │

│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> Though it might be tempting to jump into discussing shiny solution ideas, outlining and aligning on the problem space is crucial—rarely skip it.

### Avoiding Alibi-Discovery

**Alibi-Discovery:** Developing an existing top-down idea already set for the feature factory.

**Quick recognition:** Teams start their Discovery mandate with ideation sessions.

**Probing questions to test problem space understanding:**
1. What are three pieces of first-hand evidence this problem is worth solving?
2. When did you last have valid interactions with users from your target audience?
3. Can you name the specific behavior changes users would need to adopt?
4. Do you have both quantitative AND qualitative insights?

> Product Discovery is not about the number of interviewed users or experiments. Identifying the right problem space can happen in many forms.

### Connecting to Scrum: Dual-Track Agile

**Dual-Track Agile:** Simultaneously applying Agile principles to Discovery and Delivery tracks.

```
Discovery Effort    ╭──────╮        ╭──────╮
                   ╱        ╲      ╱        ╲
──────────────────╱──────────╲────╱──────────╲────────
                              ╲  ╱            ╲
Delivery Effort                ╲╱              ╲─────

                    ← Time →
```

**Key insight:** Discovery and Delivery are continuous activities, but peak efforts alternate like S-curves.

> The inconvenient truth is you probably work in a mix of Discovery and Delivery modes most of the time, with the scale tipping more in one direction at certain points.

---

### The Outcome Quadrant

Focusing on Outcomes requires the joint effect of four pillars:

| Pillar | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Product Discovery** | Exploring problems and solutions |
| **Product Strategy** | Defining how to compete and win |
| **Product Goals (OKRs)** | Quantifying success |
| **Product Roadmaps** | Making priorities tangible |

> If your Discovery feels slow or misguided, it's often not just about better interviewing skills. Ensure the three adjacent processes support your efforts too.

---

### How Product Strategy Informs Discovery

**Product Strategy Patterns:**

#### 1. Strategic Narrative (WHY)
- Vision, Principles, mid-to-long-term goals
- Why you're targeting a specific Playing Field

#### 2. Playing Field (WHERE)
- User, stakeholder, or buyer segments
- Jobs you want to help them pursue
- Alternatives users compare you against

#### 3. Winning Moves (HOW)
- Offerings and value propositions
- Channels for delivery
- Differentiation from alternatives

**Strategic Gaps Drive Discovery Priorities:**
- **Performance gap** in existing playing field → Product iteration
- **Opportunity gap** → New market or new vision

---

### How Discovery Relates to OKRs

**Challenge:** Aligning Discovery/Delivery cadence with goal cycles.

**Solution:** Lay groundwork for upcoming Delivery-oriented OKRs by anticipating Discovery-oriented, exploratory OKRs in a previous cycle.

```
Cycle N:     [Discovery OKRs - Exploratory]
Cycle N+1:   [Delivery OKRs - Based on Discovery insights]
```

---

### How Discovery Connects to Roadmaps

**Feature-based Roadmap:** Obstacle to Outcome OKRs (you're polishing existing ideas, not discovering)

**Theme-based Roadmap:** Enables Discovery with loosely-defined time horizons that become less granular further out

> When your roadmap says deliver the new start page on March 31, you're not doing Product Discovery. You're polishing an existing idea.

---

## Chapter 2: Discovery Phases and Team Participation

### Prioritizing Discovery Opportunities

**Don't use:** Simple Effort-Impact scoring (you don't know what solution to rate)

**Use instead:** Impact-Uncertainty Matrix

| | Low Uncertainty | High Uncertainty |
|---|---|---|
| **High Impact** | Ready for Delivery | Priority for Discovery |
| **Low Impact** | Consider dropping | Low priority |

> Getting started is more important than being right. Only insights collected through Discovery activities will yield results.

---

### Setting Up Your Discovery Process

**Recommended timebox:** 6 weeks

**Why 6 weeks?**
- Limited risk investment
- Easily seen as starting point, not final timeline
- Room to course-correct
- Balance of predictability and embracing uncertainty

**Common mistake:** Prioritizing time to get started over time to get valid insight.

**Better approach:** Define recruitment criteria upfront, schedule interviews with specific target audience. 1-2 weeks wait is worth it for valid insights immediately.

---

### Who Should Participate?

Not a one-size-fits-all answer. Depends on context.

| Role | Involvement |
|------|-------------|
| **Core Team** | Permanently involved throughout Discovery |
| **Contributors** | Temporarily involved for specific phases |
| **Supporters** | Provide context, feedback, organizational support |

**Two benefits of cross-domain involvement:**
1. Team generates insights and makes decisions at own pace
2. Holistic perspective avoids confirmation bias

> You should not aim to form a Product Discovery team but to make Product Discovery an integral part of YOUR team.

---

### Key Elements of Product Discovery

#### 1. Creating Alignment to Enable Autonomy

**Problem vs Solution-focused Alignment:**

| Problem-focused | Solution-focused |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Focus on outcomes and behaviors | Predetermined features |
| Open exploration | Focus on delivery dates |
| Evidence-based decisions | Assumption-based planning |
| Commitment to learning | Commitment to specific outputs |

**Key insight:** Alignment is about commitment, not agreement. It's easier to get commitment than agreement.

#### 2. Understanding Critical User Problems

**Don't fall for:** Expressing what the business wants users to do

**Instead:** Understand what's in the user's way of completing actions that contribute to business success

**Bad:** "Put more items in shopping basket"

**Good:**
- "Continue shopping without leaving basket view first"
- "Compare items on mobile without multiple browser tabs"
- "See delivery time implications without going to checkout"

**Research best practices:**
1. State research intent questions before choosing methods
2. Collect insights from multiple angles (what people say AND do)

#### 3. Collaboratively Ideating Solutions

**Actor-Job-Outcome Mapping components:**
- **Actor:** Who experiences the problem?
- **Context:** In what situation?
- **Motivation:** What are they trying to achieve?
- **Problem:** What prevents success?
- **Outcome:** What measurable change indicates progress?

## Chapter 3: Discovery Techniques and Frameworks

### The Mission Briefing

Creates alignment and commitment around a Discovery mission.

**Benefits:**
- Shared understanding of problem space
- Stakeholder commitment (not just agreement)
- Success criteria defined upfront
- Team autonomy within clear boundaries

### Impact Mapping

Connects strategic goals to user behaviors and features:

```
WHY (Goal)
    └── WHO (Actors)
            └── HOW (Impacts/Behaviors)
                    └── WHAT (Deliverables)
```

**Prevents:** Jumping straight to solutions
**Ensures:** Every feature connects back to measurable business goal

### Idea Validation Grid

Tracks validation status:
- Assumption/hypothesis
- Evidence collected
- Confidence level
- Next steps/experiments

### Actor-Job-Outcome Mapping

Connects Impact Map elements through jobs-inspired insights.

**Helps uncover:**
- Other Problems preventing same Motivation
- New Motivations overlooked
- Different Contexts you don't know about
- Different Actor strings with their own insights

## Chapter 4: Discovery Practices Reality Check

### Myth: Talk to Customers Every Week

**Problems with forced cadence:**
- Tempting to jump on what you just heard immediately
- Stop talking to the RIGHT users
- Continuously incoming insights may not be helpful
- Can lead to questioning choices repeatedly

> Just because a user problem exists doesn't mean you need to solve it. Focus research on segments relevant to strategic goals.

### Myth: More Experiments = Better Discovery

**Problems:**
- Swaps user stories for experiment techniques (same hamster wheel)
- Number doesn't tell you if team chose proper techniques
- Doesn't show if assumptions were (in)validated

> The goal is to collect strong evidence for evidence-based decisions—not ticking boxes from someone else's playbook.

## Summary

### Discovery vs Delivery Balance

| Aspect | Discovery | Delivery |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Focus** | Building the right thing | Building the thing right |
| **Space** | Problem space (primarily) | Solution space |
| **Output** | Evidence, insights, validated problems | Working software |
| **Uncertainty** | Reducing it | Executing with clarity |

### Key Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Mission Briefing** | Alignment and commitment |
| **Impact Mapping** | Goal → Actor → Impact → Deliverable |
| **Validation Grid** | Track assumption validation |
| **Actor-Job-Outcome** | Synthesize insights to actionable Outcomes |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Problem space first** — Resist jumping to solutions
2. **Avoid Alibi-Discovery** — Don't just polish existing ideas
3. **Dual-Track Agile** — Discovery and Delivery alternate in intensity
4. **Outcome Quadrant** — Strategy, Goals, Roadmaps, Discovery work together
5. **Theme-based roadmaps** — Enable Discovery; feature-based roadmaps obstruct it
6. **6-week timeboxes** — Balance predictability with uncertainty
7. **Prioritize by Impact × Uncertainty** — Not Effort × Impact
8. **Context over best practices** — Adapt to your reality, don't follow playbooks blindly
9. **Quality over quantity** — Fewer valid insights > many superficial ones
