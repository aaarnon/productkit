## Overview

Continuous interviewing is the practice of regularly engaging with customers and prospects as an ongoing habit rather than a periodic research project. It serves as a **keystone habit** that drives adoption of other continuous discovery practices.

## Why Continuous?

### The Problem with Batch Research

| Batch Research | Continuous Interviewing |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Periodic projects | Ongoing habit |
| Knowledge gets stale | Fresh insights |
| Big upfront investment | Small regular investment |
| Results arrive late | Insights flow continuously |
| Hard to course-correct | Easy to adapt |

### Keystone Habit Effect

Once teams establish regular interviewing, they more readily adopt complementary practices:
- Assumption testing
- Prototyping
- Experimentation
- Opportunity mapping

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Deliberate Practice
- **Focus** - Concentrate on specific skills each session
- **Feedback** - Review and improve technique
- **Push comfort zone** - Try new question approaches

### 2. Connection to Decisions
- Link research insights directly to product choices
- Every interview should inform current work
- Don't interview just to "understand customers"

### 3. Sustainability First
- Build habits that last
- Start small, grow over time
- Remove friction wherever possible

---

## Recommended Frequency

### Minimum Viable Cadence
- **Weekly interviews** - At least one interview per week
- **Per team member** - Each person on product trio should interview
- **Consistent schedule** - Same time each week

### Scaling Up
- Multiple interviews per week as team matures
- Different participants for different questions
- Balance prospects and existing customers

---

## Who to Interview

### Customer Types

| Type | When to Interview |
|------|-------------------|
| **Current customers** | Understanding usage, satisfaction, needs |
| **Churned customers** | Understanding why they left |
| **Prospects** | Understanding buying decisions |
| **Target segment** | Understanding market opportunity |

### Finding Participants

- Recruit from product usage
- Use support interactions
- Leverage sales pipeline
- Customer success relationships
- In-product intercepts
- External panels (for prospects)

---

## Essential Skills

### 1. Asking Effective Questions
- Story-based questions for actionable insights
- Avoid leading or hypothetical questions
- Follow-up to excavate details

### 2. Active Listening
- Stay present and curious
- Note emotional shifts
- Resist jumping to solutions
- Use silence effectively

### 3. Note-Taking
- Capture key phrases, not transcripts
- Mark moments for follow-up
- Note body language and tone

### 4. Synthesizing Learning
- Create interview snapshots
- Extract opportunities
- Connect to opportunity space

---

## The Interview Snapshot Method

### Purpose
Address information overload by capturing essentials:
- One memorable quote
- Main quick facts
- Key insights
- Emerging opportunities

### Benefits
- Easy trend identification over time
- Team-wide adoption (low barrier)
- Shareable format
- Quick to create (15-20 minutes)

## Automating Recruitment

### Why Automate?
- Removes friction from the habit
- Ensures consistent participant flow
- Reduces cognitive load on team
- Makes continuous interviewing sustainable

### Automation Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **In-product intercept** | Trigger interview request based on behavior |
| **Support integration** | Flag good interview candidates from tickets |
| **Sales handoff** | Sales passes interested prospects |
| **Customer success flow** | CSM identifies customers for feedback |
| **Scheduled panels** | Pre-recruited participants available weekly |

### Tools to Consider
- Calendly or similar for scheduling
- User research platforms (UserTesting, UserInterviews)
- CRM integration for recruitment tracking
- Incentive automation

---

## Building the Habit

### Start Small
- Begin with 30 minutes to 1 hour weekly
- Focus on one skill at a time
- Don't wait for perfect process

### Remove Barriers
- Pre-schedule interview slots
- Automate recruitment
- Have templates ready
- Share calendar with team

### Create Accountability
- Regular team share-outs
- Snapshot reviews
- Celebrate learnings
- Track participation

## Common Obstacles & Solutions

| Obstacle | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| "No time" | Start with 1 interview/week, 30 min |
| "Can't find participants" | Automate recruitment, use multiple sources |
| "Interviews feel unproductive" | Focus on stories, not opinions |
| "Team doesn't participate" | Share snapshots, show value |
| "Insights don't connect to work" | Tie to current opportunity space |
| "Process too heavy" | Use lightweight snapshots |
