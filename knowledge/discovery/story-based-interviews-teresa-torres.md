## Core Principle

Collect **specific stories about past behavior** rather than general opinions. This counteracts cognitive biases that lead people to overestimate their actions based on aspirational self-images.

## The Key Technique

### Ask for Specific Past Events

| Instead of This | Ask This |
|-----------------|----------|
| "What do you typically watch?" | "Tell me about the last time you watched streaming entertainment" |
| "How often do you exercise?" | "Tell me about the last time you exercised" |
| "How do you usually decide?" | "Walk me through how you made this specific decision" |

### Why Stories Matter

- People remember specific events more accurately than general patterns
- Stories reveal actual behavior, not idealized self-image
- Concrete details uncover context, emotions, and decision factors
- Patterns emerge across multiple stories

---

## What to Ask

### Good Questions
- Ground conversations in concrete, recent experiences
- Request detailed narratives about specific moments
- Focus on how decisions were actually made
- Ask follow-up questions to excavate deeper details
- "Tell me more about that moment when..."
- "What happened next?"
- "How did you feel when...?"

### Question Starters
- "Tell me about the last time you..."
- "Walk me through what happened when..."
- "Describe a specific situation where..."
- "Think back to a recent time when..."

## What to Avoid

| Pitfall | Why It's Problematic |
|---------|---------------------|
| **General behavioral questions** ("How often do you...?") | Invites estimates, not facts |
| **Future-oriented inquiries** ("Would you use...?") | People can't predict their future behavior |
| **Hypothetical scenarios** ("What if...?") | Responses don't match real behavior |
| **Aspirational questions** ("What do you want to...?") | Gets idealized answers, not reality |
| **Leading questions** | Biases the response |
| **Yes/No questions** | Closes down the conversation |

## Excavating Stories

### The Interviewer's Challenge

Stories rarely come out clean. Participants give fragments, jump around, or summarize instead of narrating. The interviewer must:

1. **Recognize story fragments** - Partial narratives that need expansion
2. **Prompt for details** - "What happened right before that?"
3. **Fill in gaps** - "Then what did you do?"
4. **Slow down key moments** - "Tell me more about that specific moment"
5. **Resist summarizing for them** - Let them articulate in their own words

### Active Listening Skills

- Maintain curiosity throughout
- Take notes without breaking eye contact excessively
- Use silence strategically - let them fill gaps
- Reflect back what you heard to confirm understanding
- Notice emotional shifts in the narrative

## From Stories to Insights

### Creating Interview Snapshots

After each interview, create a one-page summary featuring:

1. **Participant photo** - Helps team remember the human
2. **Memorable quote** - Captures the story essence
3. **Experience map** - Visual of the story's key moments
4. **Opportunities** - Unmet needs, pain points, desires discovered
5. **Quick facts** - Relevant context about the participant

### Pattern Recognition

- Look across multiple snapshots for recurring themes
- Note similarities in decision-making processes
- Identify common pain points
- Track unmet needs that appear repeatedly

---

## Best Practices

### Before the Interview
- Define what you want to learn (but stay open)
- Prepare story-eliciting questions
- Set up recording (with permission)
- Create comfortable environment

### During the Interview
- Start with easy, rapport-building questions
- Move to specific story requests
- Excavate details actively
- Stay curious, not confirmatory
- Take minimal notes - capture key phrases

### After the Interview
- Create snapshot immediately while fresh
- Identify 2-3 key opportunities
- Share with team asynchronously
- Add to opportunity space

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Asking about typical behavior | Ask about specific last instance |
| Accepting surface answers | Dig deeper with follow-ups |
| Talking too much | Use silence, let them fill gaps |
| Confirming your hypotheses | Stay genuinely curious |
| Taking verbatim notes | Capture essence and key quotes |
| Waiting too long to synthesize | Create snapshot same day |

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Stories over opinions** - Specific past events reveal truth
2. **Excavate actively** - Stories don't come out clean
3. **Recent is better** - Memory fades quickly
4. **Synthesize immediately** - Create snapshots while fresh
5. **Look for patterns** - Insights emerge across stories
6. **Stay curious** - Don't confirm, discover
