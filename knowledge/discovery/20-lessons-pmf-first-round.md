## Core Insight

PMF isn't one path - it's 20 different journeys. But patterns emerge: separate validation from building, understand root problems (not feature requests), pick one ICP and test thoroughly, build proof before scale.

---

## Ideation & Validation

### 1. Framework for Evaluating Ideas (Michael Grinich, WorkOS)

Assess ideas against:
- Market transition timing
- Existing expertise
- Market size
- Contrarian positioning
- Market readiness

> "If you build something and you're three years too early, you're screwed."

### 2. Avoid the "Are You My Mother?" Trap (Christina Cacioppo, Vanta)

Stop building, start listening. Asking customers "do you want this solution?" doesn't work. Talk to people until you understand their **actual problems**.

### 3. Identify Spiraling Problems (Shensi Ding, Merge)

Look for issues that **worsen over time**. Integration complexity grows as more B2B apps proliferate - a self-reinforcing problem worth solving.

### 4. Medical-Style Customer Interviews (Harry Ritter, Alma)

Apply physician diagnostic techniques:
- Narrow questions for structured data
- Open-ended questions for unexpected insights

### 5. The "Hot Knife Through Butter" Test (Ryan Noon, Material Security)

Test ideas by **attempting to sell** them:
> "Don't ask for feedback. Don't do user research—just try to sell your idea."

If it cuts through like hot knife through butter, you're onto something.

### 6. Parse What You're Validating (Manu Sharma, Labelbox)

Track separately:
- **Problem validation** - Is this a real problem?
- **Solution validation** - Is our solution right?

Avoid confirmation bias by keeping these distinct.

## Building the Right Product

### 7. Polish Over Features (Filip Kaliszan, Verkada)

Get fundamentals right rather than maximizing feature breadth. Listen for **problems**, not solution requests, to avoid bloated products.

### 8. Stay Lean and Under the Radar (Andrew Ofstad, Airtable)

Delayed public launch for **two years** to focus on core risk: making databases accessible to non-programmers. Private alpha with organic growth allowed focused iteration.

### 9. Don't Staple Features to Stalled Products (Kareem Amin, Clay)

Adding features when traction is weak doesn't work. Real demand means:
- Customers buy **incomplete** products
- They **wait** for features
- They pay despite gaps

If you need more features to sell, you don't have PMF.

## Customer Conversation Strategies

### 10. Focus on Buyers, Not Advisors (Jack Altman, Lattice)

> "The buyers are where the truth is."

After ~40 customer conversations, genuine patterns become obvious without extensive note-taking.

### 11. The 5 Whys Framework (Bryant Chou, Webflow)

Use repeated "why" questions to move past surface requests:
- Customer wanted: WordPress integration
- Real need: Customizable CMS functionality

Go deeper than the stated feature request.

### 12. Strategic Design Partner Selection (Eilon Reshef, Gong)

Target design partners with:
- Innovation mindset
- Programmatic thinking

Gong converted **11 of 12** initial partners to paying customers.

### 13. Hold ICP Loosely (David Hsu, Retool)

Initial target: FileMaker developers for small startups

Actual ICP discovered through testing: JavaScript developers at **large enterprises** managing massive internal tool budgets.

Your first ICP hypothesis is probably wrong. Test it.

### 14. Outsider Perspective as Advantage (Laura Behrens Wu, Shippo)

Leveraged inexperience - being transparent about startup stage built trust with target SMB customers. Don't fake authority you don't have.

## Market & Messaging

### 15. Cultivate the Market Proactively (Zach Perret, Plaid)

Building a developer platform means **creating market demand** itself. Monthly "Plaid Outs" community events built the fintech ecosystem before it existed.

Sometimes you need to build the market, not just the product.

### 16. Ensure Market Size Has Indefinite Legs (Jessica McKellar, Pilot)

Market size cannot be changed post-launch. Choose problems **every business faces** (like bookkeeping) to avoid acquisition-only trajectories.

### 17. Reposition into Adjacent Categories (Jason Boehmig, Ironclad)

Built a repository feature in three hours to fit the established CLM category. Positioning in **known categories** can dramatically accelerate sales.

### 18. Relatable Over Category-Defining (Guillermo Rauch, Vercel)

Don't use lofty taglines when unknown:
> "Faster websites, made easier" was simplistic but resonated.

Earn category-defining language through market proof.

### 19. Combine Product with Service (Lloyd Tabb, Looker)

Used consulting engagements and custom proofs-of-concept to demonstrate value before full product adoption. Result: **75% close rates** with near-zero early churn.

### 20. Don't Abandon After Lackluster Launch (Kate Ryder, Maven)

Faced one doula appointment on launch despite Apple feature. Success came through unscalable approaches:
- Field marketing
- Community engagement
- Eventually B2B pivots

Persistence and pivoting beat giving up.

## Summary: Common Patterns

| Pattern | Key Insight |
|---------|-------------|
| **Separate validation from building** | Talk exhaustively before coding |
| **Understand root problems** | Go deeper than feature requests (5 Whys) |
| **Pick one ICP and test** | Narrow focus reveals true fit signals |
| **Build proof before scale** | Custom implementations validate better than generic rollouts |
| **Real demand = incomplete purchases** | If they won't buy incomplete, you don't have PMF |
| **Try to sell, not survey** | Hot knife through butter test |

---

## PMF Signals to Watch For

**Positive signals:**
- Customers buy incomplete products
- Customers wait for features
- 40+ conversations show clear patterns
- High design partner conversion (>80%)
- Inbound demand without marketing

**Warning signs:**
- Need more features to close deals
- Advisors love it but buyers don't buy
- Different story from every customer
- Only works with heavy services/customization

---

## Implications for This System

**For Discovery agent:**
- Use 5 Whys to get past surface requests
- Track problem vs solution validation separately
- Apply "hot knife through butter" test
- Look for spiraling problems

**For Strategy agent:**
- Market timing matters as much as idea quality
- Consider repositioning into known categories
- Market size can't be changed - choose wisely

**For Orchestrator:**
- PMF status shapes all advice
- Pre-PMF: validation > building
- Post-PMF: scaling > more validation
