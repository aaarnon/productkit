# Prioritizing Opportunities, Not Solutions

## Core Philosophy

Product teams should stop ranking feature ideas and instead focus on identifying and prioritizing customer opportunities.

**Wrong question:** "What should we build?"

**Right question:** "What customer problems should we solve?"

---

## The Problem with Current Approaches

Teams often use spreadsheets with formulas based on "business value, user value, and technical difficulty" to rank backlog items.

**Why this fails:**
- Emphasizes output over outcomes
- Being "fixated on a ranked idea list" won't create customer value

---

## The Opportunity Solution Tree Framework

### Step 1: Discover Opportunities Through Customer Interviews

Conduct customer interviews focused on collecting narratives. Listen for:
- Needs
- Pain points
- Desires
- Wants

**Key principle:** Frame opportunities as statements customers might actually make.

**Examples:**
- ✓ "I couldn't find anything to watch"
- ✗ "I wish I binge-watched more" (aspirational, not real)

---

### Step 2: Map Related Opportunities

Group similar but distinct opportunities into hierarchical structure.

**Netflix example:**

```
"I don't know what to watch" (parent)
    ├── "I can't figure out how to search"
    ├── "I'm out of episodes"
    └── "Nothing looks interesting"
```

**Principles for grouping:**
- Ensure similarity among grouped items
- Maintain distinctness between opportunities
- Test different groupings to understand how customers think

---

### Step 3: Prioritize Using Tree Structure

**Approach:** Assess only top-level opportunities first.

Once you identify highest priority → focus on its sub-opportunities.

**Benefit:** Reduces decision complexity.

---

## Assessment Criteria

Evaluate opportunities by considering:

| Criterion | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Customer impact** | Size and frequency of impact |
| **Market positioning** | How does this affect our competitive position? |
| **Vision alignment** | Does this align with long-term vision and strategy? |
| **Customer importance** | How important is this to customers? |
| **Outcome impact** | Expected impact on desired outcomes |

---

## Decision-Making Approach

Torres advocates treating prioritization as **"two-way door decisions"** — reversible choices where teams can experiment quickly.

**Don't:**
- Develop mathematical formulas
- Seek perfect certainty

**Do:**
- Embrace subjective assessment
- Remain "open to the idea that we might have made the wrong decisions"
- Move fast and learn

---

## Strategic Outcome

> The opportunities you prioritize ultimately define your product strategy and competitive differentiation in the market.

## Summary

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| **1. Discover** | Customer interviews, collect narratives | Raw opportunities |
| **2. Map** | Group into hierarchical tree structure | Opportunity Solution Tree |
| **3. Prioritize** | Assess top-level, then drill down | Focused opportunity set |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Opportunities, not solutions** — Prioritize problems to solve, not features to build
2. **Hierarchical assessment** — Prioritize top-level first, reduces complexity
3. **Customer language** — Frame as customer statements, not aspirational wishes
4. **Two-way doors** — Embrace reversible decisions, move fast
5. **Strategic definition** — Your prioritized opportunities define your strategy
