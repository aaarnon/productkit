## What Is an Opportunity Solution Tree?

An Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) is a visual tool designed to help product teams navigate discovery and align around how to reach their business objectives. It helps teams "chart the best path to their desired outcome" while managing the iterative nature of continuous discovery.

## Core Components (4 Layers)

```
        Desired Outcome (Business/Product)
                    │
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
        ▼           ▼           ▼
   Opportunity  Opportunity  Opportunity
   (Customer    (Customer    (Customer
    need 1)      need 2)      need 3)
        │           │           │
    ┌───┼───┐   ┌───┼───┐   ┌───┼───┐
    ▼   ▼   ▼   ▼   ▼   ▼   ▼   ▼   ▼
   Sol Sol Sol Sol Sol Sol Sol Sol Sol
        │           │           │
        ▼           ▼           ▼
   Assumption  Assumption  Assumption
     Tests       Tests       Tests
```

### 1. Outcome (Root)
A product-level metric representing the business value the team aims to create.
- Examples: Increase user engagement, improve retention rates
- Defines the scope for all discovery work below

### 2. Opportunity Space (First Branch)
Unmet customer needs, pain points, and desires that, if addressed, would drive the desired outcome.
- Emerge from customer research
- Represent gaps where value can be created

### 3. Solutions (Second Branch)
Products, features, services, or workflows offered to address specific opportunities.
- Explore 3 solutions per target opportunity
- Enables comparative decision-making

### 4. Assumption Tests (Bottom Layer)
Experiments designed to validate the riskiest assumptions underlying proposed solutions.
- Generate comparative data
- Inform which path to pursue

---

## Prerequisites

Before beginning an OST, teams must have:

1. **A customer theory** - Defined understanding of target customer and value proposition
2. **A clear outcome** - Specific product-level metric to improve
3. **Customer research** - Minimum 3-4 story-based customer interviews

---

## 9-Step Creation Process

1. **Validate prerequisites** - Confirm interviews conducted and outcomes defined
2. **Position the outcome** - Place product metric at tree's root
3. **Map opportunities** - Synthesize interview data into structured opportunity space
4. **Select target** - Choose one opportunity to focus on initially
5. **Brainstorm solutions** - Generate multiple approaches to address target opportunity
6. **Narrow solutions** - Select 3 solutions to explore further
7. **Identify assumptions** - Break down each solution into underlying beliefs
8. **Test assumptions** - Run experiments validating riskiest assumptions
9. **Evaluate and iterate** - Refine, eliminate, or pivot based on results

---

## Mapping the Opportunity Space

### When to Begin
Start after collecting 3-4 customer stories. Continue weekly interviewing, updating opportunity space every 3-4 interviews.

### 4-Step Structuring Approach

1. **Create experience map** capturing all customer stories
2. **Identify key moments** in customer journey where opportunities cluster
3. **Group opportunities** under the moment each occurred
4. **Build parent-child relationships** for hierarchical structure

---

## Prioritization Framework

### Selecting a Target Opportunity

Select as soon as you have an initial opportunity space draft. Embrace a "crummy first draft" mentality.

### Evaluation Factors

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Opportunity Sizing** | How many customers experience this? How frequently? |
| **Market Factors** | How would this affect competitive positioning? |
| **Company Factors** | Does it align with mission, vision, strategy? |
| **Customer Factors** | How important to users? How satisfied with current solutions? |

### Why Effort Is Excluded

Teams often assume an opportunity is too difficult before exploring solutions. But any opportunity may have both simple and complex solutions. **Effort evaluation belongs in solution phase**, not opportunity assessment.

---

## Opportunity vs Solution Distinction

**Diagnostic test:** "Is there more than one way to address this?"
- If only one path exists → likely a solution
- If multiple approaches → it's an opportunity

| Opportunity (Good) | Solution (Bad) |
|-------------------|----------------|
| I need a quicker way to find dinner | Order takeout |
| I want meal options matching my diet | Subscribe to meal-prep |

---

## Best Practices

### Opportunity Framing
- Frame as opportunities, not just problems
- Include needs, pain points, AND desires
- Use customer language, not solution language

### Solution Comparison
Evaluate 3 solutions per target opportunity when:
- Solution risk is high
- Opportunity is a competitive differentiator
- Innovation is needed

### Outcome Guidelines
- **Single outcome per team** - Maximize impact and accountability
- **Split multiple outcomes** - If assigned multiple, prioritize and create one OST for highest-priority
- **Multiple teams, same outcome** - Split by customer segment or journey stage

---

## Determining Build Readiness

Three contextual factors:

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Risk level** | How much uncertainty surrounds the solution? |
| **Organizational risk tolerance** | What validation level required before committing? |
| **Time constraints** | How much discovery time remains? |

Low risk tolerance or ample time → more validation testing
Time pressure with lower risk → move faster

---

## Maintaining the Tree

### When to Start New Tree
When directional component of outcome changes.
- "Increase activation" → "Increase retention" = new tree
- Target adjustment (25% to 30%) = continue existing tree

### Update Frequency
Revise opportunity space every 3-4 customer interviews (approximately every 3-4 weeks).

---

## Stakeholder Communication

### Sharing Detail Levels

| Audience | What to Share |
|----------|---------------|
| **Close stakeholders** | Full tree including interviews and assumption tests |
| **Executive stakeholders** | Top-level opportunities and target opportunity only |

### Connection to Roadmaps

- **Date-based roadmaps** - Show solutions matched to opportunities and validated
- **Outcome-oriented roadmaps** - May include opportunities and solutions from OST

---

## Tools

Teams can create OSTs in any visual tool:
- **Digital whiteboards:** Miro, Mural, Jamboard, FigJam
- **Flowchart software:** Lucidchart, OmniGraffle
- **Specialized:** Vistaly (built specifically for OSTs)

---

## Key Benefits

1. **Align** on business vs customer value
2. **Understand** complete opportunity landscape before narrowing
3. **Decide better** by comparing multiple solutions
4. **Learn faster** by matching solutions to assumptions
5. **Move continuously** by limiting WIP to single target opportunities
6. **Manage stakeholders** by visualizing discovery progress
7. **Build confidence** through evidence-based prioritization

---

## Summary

### Core Principle
An OST transforms discovery from reactive feature-generation into strategic exploration. By visualizing the path from business outcomes through customer opportunities to tested solutions, teams align around impact rather than outputs.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Outcomes first** - Start with measurable business/product metric
2. **Opportunities from research** - Not assumptions or solution-requests
3. **Compare solutions** - Test 3 approaches per opportunity
4. **Validate assumptions** - Run experiments before committing
5. **Iterate continuously** - Update space every 3-4 interviews
6. **Focus on one target** - Limit work-in-progress
