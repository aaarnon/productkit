# How to Measure Product-Market Fit

**Use in:** Discovery, Strategy

## Core Definition

> **Extreme product-market fit** = widespread demand for a product solving a critical need, delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer.

PMF isn't binary - it's a spectrum. The goal is to measure where you are and know when you've arrived.

## Pre-Product Validation

### Three Foundational Questions (Sasha Orloff)

Before building, answer:
1. What are major problem areas?
2. What unique skills/insights do you possess?
3. How can this become a viable business?

### 30 Customer Conversations (Michael Sippey)

Conduct 30 pre-build meetings with target buyers exploring:

| Question | What You Learn |
|----------|----------------|
| Problem acuteness | Is this a burning problem or nice-to-have? |
| Current solutions | What workarounds exist? How painful? |
| Budget allocation | Is there money allocated to solve this? |
| Business impact | What happens if unsolved? |

> "We spent too much time thinking about features, and not enough time thinking about the problems."

## MVP Strategy

### The Peanut Butter Principle (Jiaona Zhang)

**Warning:** Spreading too thin dilutes value delivery.

Focus on the **single indispensable feature** rather than feature-bloat. Find the one thing that would make users "very disappointed" without it.

## Sean Ellis PMF Survey

### The 40% Threshold

Ask users: **"How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"**

| Response | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| Very disappointed | **>40% = strong PMF signal** |
| Somewhat disappointed | Additional context |
| Not disappointed | Churn risk |

Companies with strong traction consistently exceed 40% "very disappointed" responses. Struggling companies fall below.

### Full Survey Questions (Rahul Vohra Implementation)

1. **Disappointment level** - How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?
2. **Target persona** - What type of person do you think would benefit most from this product?
3. **Primary benefit** - What is the main benefit you receive from this product?
4. **Improvement suggestions** - How can we improve this product for you?

**Minimum sample size:** ~40 users provides directional accuracy.

### Using Survey Results

| If Score | Action |
|----------|--------|
| <40% very disappointed | Double down on discovery, find real pain |
| 40-50% very disappointed | You have something - refine and expand |
| >50% very disappointed | Strong PMF signal - consider scaling |

## North Star Metric

### Replace Metric Sprawl with Clarity

One metric that reveals true customer resonance.

**ClassPass example:** Reservations per person
- Signals churn risk
- Signals revenue potential
- Signals engagement depth
- Signals studio satisfaction

### Vanity vs Clarity Metrics

| Vanity Metric | Clarity Metric |
|---------------|----------------|
| Downloads | Daily active usage |
| Page views | Time spent on core feature |
| Signups | Activation rate |
| Total users | Retained users at 30 days |

## Signs of PMF

### PMF Present

- Rapid user growth (organic)
- Word-of-mouth spread
- Quick sales cycles
- Compounding customer value
- Users pull product from you
- Retention curves flatten (don't go to zero)

### PMF Absent

- Extended sales cycles
- Stalled deals
- Minimal organic growth
- Low retention
- Customers treat product as "nice-to-have"
- Every customer needs customization
- High acquisition cost, low LTV

## Thesis Validation Formula (Bob Moore)

```
Clear mission
+ Unique competitive advantage
+ Favorable market timing
= Resilient venture-scale company
```

All three must be present. Missing any one creates fragility.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pre-Build Validation
1. Run 30 customer conversations
2. Validate problem acuteness
3. Confirm budget allocation
4. Document current solutions

### Phase 2: MVP & Early Users
1. Build single indispensable feature
2. Get to ~40 users
3. Run Sean Ellis survey
4. Identify "very disappointed" segment

### Phase 3: Iterate Toward 40%
1. Focus on "very disappointed" users
2. Understand their primary benefit
3. Double down on that benefit
4. Ignore "not disappointed" feedback

### Phase 4: Scale (Post-40%)
1. Define North Star metric
2. Build acquisition around target persona
3. Expand from core use case

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|----------------|
| Surveying too early | Need ~40 users minimum |
| Surveying churned users | Survey current active users |
| Averaging feedback | Focus on "very disappointed" segment |
| Building for "not disappointed" | They'll never love your product |
| Declaring PMF too early | 40% is minimum, not celebration |

---

## Implications for This System

**For Discovery agent:**
- Use Sean Ellis survey as PMF validation tool
- 30 conversations before building
- Focus on "very disappointed" segment for feedback

**For Strategy agent:**
- North Star metric selection is strategic
- PMF status determines all strategy advice
- Pre-PMF ≠ Post-PMF strategies

**For Orchestrator:**
- PMF status is critical context
- Ask about Sean Ellis score if available
- Pre-PMF companies need different guidance
