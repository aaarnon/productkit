## What is OKR Theatre?

OKR Theatre occurs when organizations adopt Objectives and Key Results as a framework without genuine strategic thinking. Instead of using OKRs to create focus and alignment, companies create excessive numbers of disconnected goals that generate noise rather than clarity.

## Signs You're in OKR Theatre

### 1. Too Many Goals
- Proliferating OKRs across every level (company, department, team, individual)
- Teams inherit 5+ competing OKRs with conflicting priorities
- **Recommendation:** Fewer than 3 company-level OKRs; ideal is single unified objective

### 2. Output Over Outcome Focus
- Key Results measure activities completed rather than business impact
- Teams gravitate toward easily controllable metrics
- Measuring outputs they can guarantee rather than outcomes they influence

### 3. Missing Strategic Foundation
- OKRs appear disconnected from organizational strategy
- Goals don't connect to an underlying business model
- Random projects bundled together instead of coherent story

### 4. Rigid Cascading Structures
- OKRs perfectly mirror the org chart
- Goals forced to fit existing structures
- Not derived from strategy

### 5. Obvious or Trivial Objectives
- Goals that state basic operational necessities
- "Provide helpful service" - opposite would be foolish
- Not strategic, just maintenance

### 6. Too Many Lagging Indicators
- Relying exclusively on slow-feedback metrics
- Prevents course correction
- Need directional signals, not just year-end results

## Best Practices for Effective OKRs

### Measurable with Outcome Focus
- Format: **"From X to Y"** for specificity
- Emphasize outcomes over outputs
- Accept that external factors will influence results

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." — Goodhart's Law

### Realistic and Grounded in Strategy
- Aspirational but achievable given constraints
- Progress breeds engagement
- Consistently missing targets demoralizes

### Cohesive Across Goals
- Objectives should complement, not compete
- Growth + cost-cutting = friction
- Growth + retention = synergy

### Clear Connection to Underlying Models
- Stakeholders should connect daily work to broader goals
- If explanation requires significant translation, framework isn't clear

### Alignment, Not Cascading
- Shared strategy creates natural alignment
- Don't force top-down goal cascades
- Rarely align with actual work priorities

### Direction Plus Speed
- Monitor directional correctness (right way?)
- Monitor velocity (how fast?)
- Don't sacrifice direction for speed

### Balance of Leading and Lagging
- Include early-signal metrics
- Reveal whether you're on track
- Not just end-result measures

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Problematic |
|---------|---------------------|
| **OKRs tied to compensation** | Creates gaming behavior, not genuine outcomes |
| **OKRs separate from strategy** | Disconnected goals that don't matter |
| **Too many goals** | Diluted focus, competing priorities |
| **Vague language** | Teams uncertain where to focus |
| **Measuring activities** | Outputs instead of outcomes |
| **Matching org structure** | Artificial goal cascades |

## How to Escape OKR Theatre

### Diagnostic Question
Ask whether OKRs clarify focus and create shared understanding, or whether they've become administrative burden.

### The Fix
1. **Ground in strategy first** - OKRs express strategic choices, not substitute for them
2. **Reduce quantity** - Fewer goals with more focus
3. **Outcome-orient** - Measure what changed, not what you did
4. **Add leading indicators** - Get early signals
5. **Create cohesion** - Goals should complement each other
6. **Stop cascading** - Align naturally through shared strategy

## OKR Health Check

| Symptom | Healthy OKR | OKR Theatre |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Number of goals** | 1-3 per level | 5+ competing OKRs |
| **Goal type** | Outcomes | Outputs/activities |
| **Strategic connection** | Clear story | Random projects |
| **Indicator balance** | Leading + lagging | Lagging only |
| **Structure** | Strategy-driven | Org chart-driven |
| **Team understanding** | Clear focus | Uncertain priorities |

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Less is more** - Fewer goals create more focus
2. **Outcomes over outputs** - Measure impact, not activities
3. **Strategy first** - OKRs express strategy, don't replace it
4. **Balance indicators** - Leading metrics for early signals
5. **Align, don't cascade** - Natural alignment through shared strategy
6. **Regular review** - OKRs should clarify, not burden

### The Test
If OKRs feel like administrative overhead rather than strategic clarity, you're likely in OKR Theatre. The solution is returning to genuine strategic thinking, not better OKR mechanics.
