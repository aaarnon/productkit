## Overview

A hands-on guide for making OKRs work in Product Management—from setting goals to connecting them with Product Strategy, Roadmaps, Discovery, and Scrum.

**Core insight:** Finding success through OKRs doesn't depend on just the type, quality, and choice of metrics, but even more on **how you use them**.

## Chapter 1: OKR Fundamentals for Product Managers

### Common Struggles

- Preplanned OKR sets that specify features, leaving no room for behavior change focus
- Unclear how OKRs benefit Product Discovery and Delivery
- Confusion about how OKRs, Strategy, Discovery, Roadmaps, and Scrum connect

### Three Attributes of Effective OKRs

Beyond "by the book" definitions:

#### 1. Rooting in Proven Evidence or Explicit Explorative Goals

OKRs are about focus. Teams need clear reasoning for why a certain OKR is worth attention.

> Outcome OKRs don't talk about features. They shift conversation to the impact a team should seek to make.

#### 2. High Relevancy for Everyday Decision-Making

If Key Results don't influence what a team is doing, they are useless. OKRs that only change in hindsight or describe goals outside a team's influence don't provide value.

#### 3. Clear Connection to Company Priorities

The OKR definition process should involve all levels. Single teams get inspired by company direction to define their contribution.

**Tip:** Plan for an Alignment Period well before the next quarter to avoid "rush and commit" behaviors.

### Comparing OKRs and Product Strategy

**Product Strategy:** Outlines broader efforts to move closer to long-term Product Vision

**OKRs:** Implement specific aspects of Product Strategy throughout short cycles

#### The Product Strategy-Metrics Sandwich

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         NORTH STAR METRICS              │
│         (Long-term success)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         PRODUCT STRATEGY                │
│         (Vision → actionable direction) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              OKRs                       │
│         (Quarterly execution)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Product Strategy patterns:**
- **Strategic Narrative:** Vision, Principles, mid-to-long-term goals (the WHY)
- **Playing Field:** Market focus, audiences, jobs to be done, alternatives
- **Strategic Choices:** Customer segments, value propositions, differentiation

> If you don't have a clear and tangible Product Strategy, it does not make sense to use OKRs.

---

### The OKR Cycle for Product Teams

- Common cycle length: One quarter (but adaptable)
- Pick length that allows measuring change without spanning too long

**Key practice:** Regular check-ins (weekly or biweekly) throughout the cycle

> Don't feel surprised at the end of a cycle if goals haven't been reached, but you also didn't regularly revisit them and adjust actions.

---

### Establishing Your WHY Behind Using OKRs

Starting questions:
- What does the organization we want look like?
- Why do we want to work with OKRs?
- What do we want to achieve with OKRs specifically in Product Management?

**OKR System MVP questions:**
- Will you start with a pilot team?
- Who facilitates the OKR process?
- What is the decision-making process?
- What aspects of work do OKRs cover?
- How are OKRs integrated into existing routines and tools?

---

## Chapter 2: How to Define OKRs in Product Management

### Capturing Holistic Product Success

**Required inputs for OKR definition:**
- Company/department OKR sets
- Company Purpose and Vision
- Product Strategy and North Star Metrics
- Previous OKR sets and Theme-based Roadmap elements
- Proven user problems or validated solutions

### Exemplary Holistic Success Metrics

Beyond just revenue or growth:
- Conversion rates
- Customer satisfaction (NPS)
- Product reviews (G2, App Store)
- Onboarding completion rates
- Sales team behavior changes
- User testing results
- Churn/retention metrics

### Product Team OKR Definition Process

**Collaborative workshop approach:**
1. Dedicated facilitator guides the process
2. Set stage by revisiting all relevant inputs
3. Domain experts focus on content

**Key insight:** OKR definition is more art than science. Don't force a linear Objective → Key Results path.

Teams can:
- Start with Key Results and work backward to Objectives
- Start with Objectives then define Key Results
- Iterate between both

---

### Outcome vs. Output OKRs

**Outcome:** A measurable change in behavior that contributes to an Impact

**Output:** An artifact delivered through activities

> An Outcome is a change in human behavior that creates an Impact.

OKRs can work with either, but being aware of the difference is essential.

**Tip:** Rephrase Key Results as "How might we...?" to sanity-check Outcome focus.

| Aspect | Output OKR | Outcome OKR |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Focus | Features and deliverables | Behavior changes and impact |
| Flexibility | Constrained to specific solution | Open to solution exploration |
| Example | "Launch mobile app" | "50% of users complete tasks on mobile" |

---

### Leading vs. Lagging OKRs

One of the most overlooked criteria for selecting Key Results.

**Lagging indicators:** By the time they change (revenue, user growth), you can't tie them to specific efforts

**Leading indicators:** Help teams measure success and progress within the cycle

**Critical question for leading indicators:**
> "Which customer behaviors do we need to encourage to achieve our business goal?"

```
Lagging (Business Impact)
         ↑
Leading (Behavior Change)
         ↑
Team Actions
```

Leading indicators help predict contribution to company impact and increase/decrease confidence in pursuing a problem space.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> OKRs are a "strategy in a nutshell" for individual Product Teams, connecting short- and mid-term priorities to the overarching WHY.

### Enabling Outcome OKRs through Product Roadmaps

**Roadmaps serve as:**
- Input for OKR drafting
- Output to communicate priorities for achieving OKRs

**Feature-based Roadmap:** More obstacle than enabler of Outcome OKRs

**Theme-based Roadmap:** Balances guidance with autonomy for solution decisions

> You don't need to turn Key Results into release dates and Gantt charts. Themes inform OKR priorities and vice versa.

---

### OKRs in Product Discovery

**Product Discovery answers:**
1. Why is this a problem worth solving?
2. What solutions are worth pursuing?

**Challenge:** Timing within quarterly cycles
- Discovery phase takes time
- Implementation takes time
- Behavior change measurement needs post-launch time

**Two options for Discovery-phase OKRs:**

#### Option 1: Health Metrics / Way-of-Working OKRs

Set thresholds for how your working might change:
- Number of user interactions conducted
- Share of quantitative/qualitative research efforts
- Cycle times for user interaction or idea testing

#### Option 2: Product Discovery Progress Metrics

Understand if critical assumptions are accurate:
- Usability test success/completion rates
- Customer effort score in prototype testing
- Open rate and CTR from experiment emails
- Opt-in/opt-out rates for beta programs

> By agreeing on and regularly revisiting exploratory Discovery OKRs, Product Teams can raise awareness for this often unseen part of their work.

---

### Combining OKRs and Scrum

**Key practice:** As many backlog items as possible should associate with an OKR.

This connects everyday tasks with organizational goals.

**Implementation:**
- Custom fields in JIRA linking stories to OKRs
- Same approach for Asana, Trello, monday.com
- Establish temporary links between tasks and OKRs

---

## Chapter 4: Finding Your Own Path to Outcomes

### The Real Challenge

Not the complexity of OKR methodology, but:
- Rigidness of how OKRs are promoted elsewhere
- Lacking iteration and adaptation mindset
- Prescriptive frameworks and "right OKR" how-to guides
- Dogma about Outcomes being "the only right way"

### The Path Forward

- Begin from an imperfect starting point
- Don't be discouraged by over-glorified definitions of Outcomes
- Regular practice of reflection and adaptation

> Don't follow a prescribed OKR approach others came up with. You have the unfair advantage of knowing your organization. Use that advantage to find your approach.

## Summary

### OKR Definition Checklist

| Input | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Company OKRs | Strategic direction |
| Product Strategy | Context and choices |
| North Star Metrics | Long-term success measure |
| Previous OKRs | Learning and continuity |
| Discovery insights | Proven problems/solutions |

### Key Distinctions

| Concept | Distinction |
|---------|-------------|
| **Outcome vs Output** | Behavior change vs delivered artifact |
| **Leading vs Lagging** | Predictive vs retrospective |
| **Feature vs Theme Roadmap** | Prescriptive vs flexible |

### Integration Points

| Domain | OKR Connection |
|--------|----------------|
| **Product Strategy** | OKRs implement strategy aspects |
| **Product Roadmaps** | Themes ↔ OKR priorities |
| **Product Discovery** | Discovery OKRs for visibility |
| **Scrum** | Backlog items linked to OKRs |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Strategy first** — Without clear Product Strategy, OKRs don't make sense
2. **Regular check-ins** — THE opportunity to adjust actions
3. **Outcome focus** — Change in behavior, not features
4. **Leading indicators** — Enable mid-cycle course correction
5. **Theme-based roadmaps** — Enable Outcome OKRs
6. **Find your own path** — Don't follow prescriptive approaches blindly
7. **Start imperfect** — Better to begin than to wait for perfect OKRs
