# Product Prioritization Strategy

## Priority Should Be Obvious

> If we have a prioritization problem, then we actually have a strategy problem.

### Why Most Frameworks Are Useless

**RICE, MoSCoW, Kano** and dozens of others are useless.

**Why:** When it's difficult to make a decision, it means the options are basically the same.

---

## Results Are Distributed Logarithmically

Results are NOT distributed linearly.

**Reality:**
- Some things give you **1x impact**
- Others give you **100x impact**
- For many teams, **one backlog item delivers more than everything else combined**

---

## The Focus Test

If it's not blindingly obvious what is the most valuable work, then you probably don't understand your users or their needs well enough.

**Most businesses have:**
- 2-3 core user needs
- 1-2 core distribution channels

**→ Focus on these things.**

---

## The Hard Things First Paradox

**The problem:** Big things require lots of effort. Taking a quarter for one important improvement seems risky.

**The alternative:** Fill work with motion (new features) that ship with no particular value (no metric improvement).

> 👉 **It is always better to take the time to get the hard things done first.**

---

## Structured Prioritization

Sometimes PMs need structured rationale to defend their view.

**Two key aspects:**
1. Discovery evidence balance
2. Company stage understanding

---

### a) Balance on Discovery Efforts

**Discovery Work = Confidence × Time (and Money)**

Too much evidence gathering = waste of resources

Too little = low confidence

**Sweet spot:** Understand when more data leads to diminishing returns.

---

### DHM Assessment During Discovery

Classify each opportunity's level of:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **DELIGHT** | How does the product delight customers (today and future)? |
| **HARD TO COPY** | Will this lead to hard-to-copy advantages? |
| **MARGIN-ENHANCING** | How will we deliver value to business? (price, business model) |

**Hard to Copy advantages:**
1. Network effects
2. Brand
3. Technology
4. Economies of scale
5. Switching costs
6. Captured resources
7. Process power

---

### b) Balance Roadmap "Work" According to Company Stage

**Common startup mistake:**
> "If we aren't growing, the solution is to create X feature."

A new feature could be the answer, but often isn't. Most product teams know how to develop features, but don't understand the other growth levers.

**Solution:** Understand startup stage → prioritize appropriate "work type"

---

## Four Work Types by Company Stage

### 1. Feature Work

**Creating and extracting value** by expanding product and market functionality into complementary and related areas.

**PM focus:**
- User Research & Analysis
- Opportunity Mapping
- Prototyping & Testing

---

### 2. Growth Work

**Creating and extracting value** by accelerating adoption and use in the existing market.

**PM focus:**
- Data Analysis
- Hypothesis-Driven Development
- Rapid Iteration
- Behavioral Economics

---

### 3. Scaling Work

**Focusing on bottlenecks** so the team can continue to move forward and take on new levels of work on features, growth, and expanding PMF.

**PM focus:**
- Technical Acumen
- Process Optimization
- Compliance & Security
- Cross-Functional Collaboration

---

### 4. PMF Expansion Work

**Increasing the ceiling** of product's market fit in a non-incremental manner by expanding into adjacent market, adjacent product, or both.

**PM focus:**
- Strategic Vision
- Market Research
- Project Management
- Risk Management

---

## Summary

### The Hierarchy

```
1. Strategy clarity (makes priority obvious)
    ↓
2. Focus on 2-3 core needs, 1-2 core channels
    ↓
3. If not obvious → Need better user understanding
    ↓
4. When structured defense needed:
    a. Balance discovery (confidence vs time)
    b. Understand company stage (work type)
```

### Key Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Logarithmic distribution** | One thing often > everything else |
| **Obviousness test** | If unclear → strategy problem |
| **Hard things first** | Better than motion without value |
| **DHM assessment** | Delight, Hard to Copy, Margin-enhancing |
| **Stage-appropriate work** | Feature, Growth, Scaling, or PMF Expansion |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Strategy makes priority obvious** — If it's not obvious, fix strategy first
2. **Focus ruthlessly** — 2-3 core needs, 1-2 core channels
3. **Logarithmic results** — Some things 100x more valuable
4. **Hard things first** — Better than many easy, low-value things
5. **Discovery balance** — Confidence vs diminishing returns
6. **DHM framework** — Assess opportunities during discovery
7. **Match work to stage** — Feature, Growth, Scaling, or PMF Expansion
