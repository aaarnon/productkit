# How to achieve High Velocity Decision Making

**Author:** Ed Biden

Making good decisions is a core skill for any product manager. Whether you are deciding which problems to solve, prioritizing features in the backlog, or hiring the best colleagues, the quality of your decisions goes a long way to defining how effective you will be. It's not enough just to make good decisions though – you have to make good decisions quickly. When you make high quality decisions at a high velocity, the result is a more responsive, nimble organization that spends more time executing on high value activities, and less time debating low value issues. Organizations which have mastered the art of high velocity decision making are able to maximize their organizational effectiveness overall, giving them a competitive advantage.

## High Velocity Decision Making: Using types of decisions

The blueprint for this type of thinking is Amazon, who first highlighted the competitive and organizational advantage of embedding high velocity decision making as a company cultural advantage. Jeff Bezos famously defined two types of decisions in his 2016 letter to shareholders:

### Type 1 Decisions – "One-Way Doors"

- Almost impossible to reverse. You can't go back to way things were
- Rare
- Must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation
- Aim to get right, make it work
- **Examples:** Sunsetting product, brand redesign, pricing changes

### Type 2 Decisions – "Two-Way Doors"

- Easily reversible. You don't have to live with consequences for long
- Common
- Should be made quickly by small groups or individuals with good judgment
- Aim to get right, but act fast and course correct over time
- **Examples:** most product launches, copy changes, changing cadence or format of a meeting

These two types of decisions represent two ends of a spectrum, rather than a binary categorization. Most decisions are closer to the Type 2 end of the spectrum, and then a few key decisions are at the Type 1 end. The point of categorizing them is to allow you to understand where you should spend time deliberating the outcome, and where you should allow a quick decision, thereby ensuring a high velocity of decision making overall.

#### Decision Types Spectrum

This chart illustrates the relationship between decision incidence and importance across Type 2 and Type 1 decisions.

| Axis | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Y-axis (Incidence)** | 0% to 100% | Frequency of decision occurrence |
| **X-axis (Importance)** | Low to High | Stakes and impact of the decision |
| **Type 2 zone** | Left side | Reversible, common decisions with high incidence and low importance |
| **Type 1 zone** | Right side | Irreversible, rare decisions with low incidence and high importance |
| **Curve pattern** | Declining | Orange curve shows most decisions are low stakes (high incidence at low importance, declining sharply as importance increases) |

**Key insight:** Most decisions are low stakes – the vast majority of decisions fall into the Type 2 category and should be made quickly.

## High Velocity Decision Making: Informing your decisions

> "As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention" – Jeff Bezos

It's tempting to aim for perfect decision making all the time. But when you recognise that lots of decisions can be easily reversed, it makes more sense to weigh the cost of making a decision against the cost of reversing it. Equally, it makes sense to weigh the cost of definitely making the right decision versus the opportunity cost of not making a decision today.

People are often nervous about making decisions with partial or imperfect information. Knowing when to stop gathering information and make a decision is one of the key levers to speed up decision making. Typically gathering information for a decision is not a linear, but rather follows a Pareto principle: 80% of the information can be found in 20% of the time. As a PM you have access to existing research, analytical tooling and you know how previous features were received by users. This information doesn't take long to gather, and gives you significant context on the problem at hand.

But if you want really specific information to push further towards 100% confidence, the time required goes up exponentially. Recruiting fresh user testers, inserting more tracking events into the code, and building variants for split tests can easily take weeks or months, especially if done repeatedly.

### Information Gathering Curve

This chart shows the relationship between time spent gathering information and the amount of information available for decision-making.

| Axis | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Y-axis (Amount of information needed to decide)** | 0% to 100% | How much information you have |
| **X-axis (Time to gather information)** | Low to High | Time investment required |
| **Type 2 zone** | Left side | 0-80% information range - gather quickly for reversible, common decisions |
| **Type 1 zone** | Right side | 80-100% information range - requires significant time for irreversible, rare decisions |
| **Curve pattern** | S-curve | Orange curve shows rapid initial information gain (80% achieved quickly), then diminishing returns (final 20% takes exponentially longer) |

### Key insights

- 80% of useful information can be gathered in 20% of the time (Pareto principle)
- The final 20% of information requires exponentially more time investment
- You should never wait for all the information to make a decision

### The cost of gathering information

Taking this time to gather information means being slow and has a cost:

- Opportunity cost of your time as you gather the information and debate the decision
- Opportunity cost of delaying getting a new feature out to your users

It follows that most decisions, which are low stakes, can and should be made with 70% – 80% of the information that can be gathered quickly. Recognising this allows you to make decisions faster and realize more business value. Only a few critical decisions are Type 1 decisions that should be made when you've taken the time to get >90% of the information (see the D.E.C.I.D.E. framework). Beware getting caught in a cycle of gathering endless data, or "analysis paralysis", as the cost of deciding can spiral and is unlimited.

## High Velocity Decision Making: Lightweight Decision Making

For smaller decisions that would still benefit from some sort of framework, you want to keep it lightweight to allow you to think through the topic thoroughly but still achieve a high velocity of decision making. One simple, but powerful variation on a pros and cons list is to add mitigations, in a nod to the fact that most decisions can be reversed.

### Benefits, Costs and Mitigations Framework

This table framework helps structure fast, high-quality decisions by evaluating multiple options across three dimensions.

| Row | Column A | Column B | Column C |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|
| **Benefits** | Benefit, Benefit | Benefit, Benefit | Benefit, Benefit |
| **Costs & Risks** | Cost, Risk | Cost, Risk | Cost, Risk |
| **Mitigations** | Action, Action | Action, Action | Action, Action |

### Key insights

- Always evaluate at least 2-3 options (never justify a single answer)
- List benefits for each option
- Identify costs and risks for each option
- Define specific mitigation actions that can address the risks

## Why you need at least two options

Always make sure that you have at least two options. It can be tempting to jump straight into justifying a single answer, but this is lazy and unhelpful:

- It shows that you haven't spent the time to investigate other courses of action
- There's no consideration of the trade off between different risks and opportunities
- It doesn't given leaders and other stakeholders an opportunity to input into the decision
- It actually slows down decision making velocity by requiring rework

Filling out the benefits and costs should be fairly straightforward. You'll want to make sure that each option has roughly the same amount of detail in its column, otherwise it's likely you haven't thought through the options equally, and aren't really giving them a chance. You'll also want to make sure that risks are included in the costs section, as this will set up addressing the mitigations later.

## Working through mitigations

Working through the mitigations for each option has several benefits:

- It reinforces the realization that most decisions are reversible, and shouldn't be overthought
- It makes each option more concrete as you're thinking about what would happen if you actually chose it
- It stimulates new ideas as you work out if risks can be minimized or avoided in different ways
- It facilitates a higher decision making velocity overall

Some good questions to facilitate the discussion around mitigations are:

- What is the root cause of that cost? Can we mitigate it?
- Can we address this in other ways? (e.g. ops solution vs. tech solution)
- What are we really worried about here?
- Is there a long-term / short-term tradeoff we can make?

## Tips For High Velocity Decision Making

> "I believe that speed, like exercise and eating healthy, can be habitual." – Dave Girouard, CEO UpStart

Committing to high-velocity decision making requires a cultural shift, as most organizations become more risk averse and slower as they grow. Here are 7 tips for helping you ingrain a culture of high velocity decision making.

### 1. Be clear on the decider

> "Make decisions; be accountable. It's not always clear who should make a decision. Effective leaders embrace decision-making in cases of murky ownership, either making the call themselves or collaborating across the necessary teams to drive an outcome. They clearly communicate decisions and hold themselves and their teams accountable for results." – Stripe Operating Principles for Leaders

Ambiguity around who can make a decision is perhaps the biggest enemy of effective and high velocity decision making. If it's not clear who is taking a decision then no one will be driving the process of making it. Beyond that, anyone who is trying to push forward a decision is likely to default to consensus based decision-making, which is often the opposite of high velocity decision making and frequently leads to poor quality compromises.

Don't be afraid to ask "who is the decider on this?", and as a leader, don't shy away from making this clear. It can feel uncomfortable to give this authority to one person over others, but it's much less painful for the organization in the long run.

If there seems to be ambiguity about who the decider is in a team regularly, then this is a good sign that the roles and responsibilities for people aren't clear. Thrashing out who is accountable for what can be done in an hour or two. That might seem like a long time in a fast-paced environment, but if it's resolving persistent tension that's flaring up weekly, it's well worth it.

### 2. Set a timeline

> "Deciding on when a decision will be made from the start is a profound, powerful change that will speed everything up." – Dave Girouard, CEO UpStart

A great technique for preventing decisions rumbling on too long is to set a deadline for the decision to be made. Of course this needs to be stuck to, but once ingrained as part of a company's culture, it can be an effective forcing function to make things happen. Keep the scope of the decision tight, and don't let other people drag in other issues that don't need to be resolved at the same time. Book a meeting to present your decision to the key stakeholders when the deadline falls – the public commitment to decide by that point will help keep you on track.

### 3. Get some perspective

If you are worried that you are overinvesting in a decision, then getting some perspective can often unblock things. Try asking yourself one of these questions:

- Which decision will look best in 3 years time?
- How would I explain this to my boss?
- What would be best for our customers?

Thinking through these questions can help you identify what are smaller factors that you shouldn't get too caught up in, and what is the real heart of the matter that needs to be correct.

### 4. Listen for and address dissent

Just because you are the decider, doesn't mean you should take decisions in a vacuum. Only the most trivial decisions don't have ramifications on the people around you, and they will want their say. Be clear on who you need to involve in a decision, and then really listen to them. You don't have to agree with them, but ignoring them completely is guaranteed to trip you up later, as you won't have their buy-in to follow through.

Good follow up questions to ask include:

- Can you explain in more detail why you see it that way?
- Sounds like you've got strong views on this – what convinced you?
- How do you think this relates to our overall strategy?
- Is this a symptom of something larger?

### 5. Rely on guiding principles

Wherever possible, the decisions should be framed by overarching company strategy, values and principles. Relying on higher order principles makes it far easier to pick a course of action, and get buy in for it. For example, Cisco has "Make it secure by design, private by default" as a product principle. Articulating this publicly and clearly cuts through a host of lower level decisions about which features to prioritize, or how to build them.

#### Cisco Product Principles Example

**Make it secure by design, private by default**

*vs. a feature bolted-on at the end*

We cannot win our customers' trust unless security is inherent in every line of code we write, and every solution we design. So when it comes to a customer's data, we put their privacy ahead of our own interests. Any use of data will be transparent, honest, and always opt-in. It is our fundamental belief that privacy is a basic human right.

**Key insight:** The principle "Make it secure by design, private by default" serves as a clear decision-making filter that cuts through numerous lower-level product decisions about feature prioritization and implementation.

Such principles are variously called values, operating principles and so on, but what really matters is that they provide clear direction to employees on how to act. The best companies put a lot of effort into assessing for matching values during recruitment, explaining them with examples of expected behavior, and end up talking about them daily. These are not slogans pasted to the wall, but razors to cut through decisions and accelerate action.

Conversely, if you see a decision is becoming particularly contentious, then this could be a sign that the higher order questions haven't been resolved. In this case you should quickly escalate things and get guidance. If teams are fundamentally misaligned with very different goals and opinions, then no amount of discussion will resolve that. "You've worn me down" is no way to win an argument – it's slow, leads to bad decisions, and destroys morale. Get help straight away before you get bogged down.

Finally – it's important that you and your organization are aligned on the value of high velocity decision making. If high velocity decision making is not a value or cultural trait within your organization, it's important to recognise that. It could be that you work in an industry, such as healthcare, where mistakes have far bigger consequences. Or maybe you just haven't talked about it in your team. Talk with your colleagues and manager if you think high velocity decision making could help your organization.

### 6. Disagree and commit

You can often short circuit a decision that is in danger of running on too long by asking for people to disagree and commit. This should acknowledge that with the information currently available, either point of view could be right, and it's more important to take action than keep debating.

Making this work requires nurturing this behavior in an organization. People need to recognize the value of high velocity decision making, that they personally don't need to be right all the time, and that they'll have people disagree and commit with them as often as they do it for others. Creating a high velocity decision making culture that works this way means that leaders need to role model this behavior, and from time-to-time be willing to trust their teams and commit to decisions they don't agree with themselves.

Finally, the commitment needs to be genuine. It's not admitting defeat or deciding that chasing the issue isn't worth it. It's recognizing that your point of view has been heard, accepting that it could be wrong, and in that light doing everything possible to support the chosen course of action to success. As long as it's a Type 2 decision, you should prioritize high velocity of decision making.

### 7. Be ready to adapt

While you always want to make the right decision, when you are valuing high velocity decision making over perfection of the solution, you are bound to make the odd mistake. If you've already identified your mitigations in advance, then adapting if things don't go 100% to plan shouldn't be a big deal. You recognize what went wrong, learn from it, adapt and move on.

Key to adapting quickly are two factors.

First, you need to have feedback loops in place so you know whether a decision was successful or not. This could be as simple as checking in with the team a couple of weeks after a process change, or having dashboards ready and set up as new features go live. If you can, set targets when you make the decision and before you take action. With less invested in the solution you'll have a more dispassionate view of what success looks like.

Second, you need a culture of psychological safety, so that mistakes can be readily admitted and dealt with. Rocket Internet was a great example of this. In the mid 2010s it had the ambitious goal of being able to launch a business in 100 days. Needless to say, when you're moving at this pace, things go wrong all the time. The conversation when something did go wrong was never about pointing fingers though, but rather relentlessly forward focused: "Ok, what happens now? What do we need to do to get back on track?". As a result mistakes were identified and resolved quickly and without drama, and most importantly, speed was maintained.

## Summary

Making good decisions isn't just about getting to the right decision, it's about allocating the appropriate time to making a decision. Spending too long making small decisions means the cost of making the decision is larger than the cost of correcting it if you are wrong.

Low stakes, reversible decisions should be made quickly by small groups. High stakes, irreversible decisions should be made after significant research and deliberation. When you value high velocity decision making appropriately, you free yourself up to spend more time executing on high value activities. That means you're going to get more done, and ultimately create more impact.

## FAQs

### What is high-velocity decision making?

High-velocity decision making is a decision-making process that emphasizes speed and agility, often used in fast-paced, dynamic environments like startups and technology companies. The goal is to make decisions quickly and efficiently, in order to maintain the pace of execution. High-velocity decision making allows organizations to respond quickly to changes in their environment, identify and capitalize on new opportunities, and stay ahead of the competition. It also prevents companies from overinvesting in decisions that are easily reversible, or inconsequential.

### How do you make decisions faster?

To make fast decisions you should:

- Be clear on who has the authority to make the decision
- Set a deadline by which the decision should be made
- Think through the decision from your users', or boss's perspective
- Listen and address conflicting views, so they don't come back to bite you
- Use high level principles to guide your decisions (e.g. privacy first)
- Be willing to disagree and commit, rather than insist on consensus
- Look to act and adapt, rather than needing to be perfect first time round

### What does fast decision making mean in startups?

Fast decision making in startups means making decisions quickly and efficiently, often with limited information or resources, in order to capitalize on opportunities, respond to market changes, and stay ahead of competitors. Often this means taking a decision when you only have 70-80% of the information you might ideally want, as collecting the remaining 20-30% of information can take a significant amount of time. Most decisions deserve less than 10 minutes discussion. Taking these decisions quickly leaves you more time for the few decisions that are important and irreversible, and require significant research, thought and deliberation before taking.

### What is a type 1 or one way door decision example?

A type 1 decision is one that cannot easily be reversed. If you go through this door and don't like what's on the other side, it's impossible or very difficult to go back. Some examples would be:

- Choosing or moving to a new technology stack
- Hiring or firing a critical employee (perhaps someone on the leadership team)
- Changing business model (e.g. moving from one off payments to a subscription)
- Raising a new round of finance, or taking on new investors

### What is a type 2 or two way door decision example?

A type 2 decision is one that can easily be reversed. If you go through this door and don't like what's on the other side, it's easy to go back to where you started. Some examples would be:

- Changing the copy or color of UI elements
- AB testing a new feature
- The cadence or format of standing meetings
- The messaging, images and channels in marketing campaigns

### What is the advantage of fast decision making?

Fast decision making means you aren't over investing in decisions that are unimportant or reversible. The result is that you have more time to invest in high value activities, get more done, and ship improvements faster and more regularly. Overall, this allows companies to be more innovative, adaptive and dynamic, and ultimate results in better business performance.
