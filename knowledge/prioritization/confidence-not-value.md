# Prioritization is About Confidence, Not Value

## Overview

Instead of debating abstract "value," teams should prioritize based on **confidence levels**: How sure are we this solves a real problem? How confident are we in the outcome?

Value is only realized once shipped. Until then, you're making bets with varying confidence.

## The Problem with "Value"

### Value is Vague

"Value" can mean:
- Business value (revenue, cost savings)
- User value (satisfaction, task completion)
- Customer value (retention, expansion)
- Strategic value (market position, capability building)

Teams using "value" as a criterion often talk past each other because they're measuring different things.

---

### Value is Unknowable Until Shipped

> "Value is only realized once it is in your customer's hands. Until then you're making a bet."

Before launch, you have:
- Estimates (guesses with varying rigor)
- Assumptions (beliefs that may be wrong)
- Hypotheses (testable predictions)

None of these are value. They're confidence levels about potential value.

---

## The Confidence Reframe

Instead of asking "What's most valuable?" ask:

**"How confident am I that this solves a real problem?"**

This reframe does several things:
1. Makes uncertainty explicit
2. Points toward what would increase confidence
3. Separates bets from sure things
4. Creates actionable next steps

## Confidence at Each Layer

The layered prioritization model applies here too:

| Layer | Value Question (Vague) | Confidence Question (Actionable) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Strategy | "Which strategy is most valuable?" | "How confident are we this is the right path?" |
| Outcomes | "Which outcome has most value?" | "How confident are we this outcome matters?" |
| Opportunities | "Which opportunity is most valuable?" | "How confident are we this is a real problem?" |
| Solutions | "Which solution delivers most value?" | "How confident are we this solves it?" |

## Discovery as Confidence-Building

Product discovery isn't about finding "valuable" things to build. It's about **building or destroying confidence** in your bets.

### High Confidence Work
- Problem validated through research
- Evidence from user behavior
- Aligned with proven strategy
- Similar patterns succeeded before

**Action:** Execute. Less discovery needed.

### Low Confidence Work
- Assumption-based
- No user evidence
- New strategic territory
- First-of-kind bet

**Action:** Discover first. Build confidence before building product.

## The Confidence Ladder

```
CONFIDENCE LEVEL    EVIDENCE TYPE              ACTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Validated           Behavior data, A/B tests   Ship it
Strong              User research, analogues   Small bet, iterate
Moderate            Expert opinion, logic      Test hypothesis first
Weak                Gut feel, requests         Discovery needed
None                Pure speculation           Don't build yet
```

## Practical Application

### Instead of "Is this high value?"

Ask:
1. **Problem confidence:** How sure are we users have this problem?
2. **Importance confidence:** How sure are we it matters enough to solve?
3. **Solution confidence:** How sure are we this approach works?
4. **Outcome confidence:** How sure are we it moves our metrics?

Rate each 1-5. Low scores point to where discovery is needed.

---

### Prioritization Becomes Discovery Planning

Low confidence items aren't deprioritized. They're **routed to discovery**.

```
High confidence + High impact → Build
High confidence + Low impact  → Maybe later
Low confidence + High impact  → Discover first
Low confidence + Low impact   → Skip
```

---

## Why This Works Better

| "Value" Approach | Confidence Approach |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Debates opinions | Identifies evidence gaps |
| Rewards persuasive pitches | Rewards validated bets |
| Hides uncertainty | Makes uncertainty explicit |
| Build then learn | Learn then build |
| Hope for value | Increase odds of value |

## Integration with Teresa Torres' Work

This aligns with Opportunity Solution Trees:
- **Opportunities** = problems with varying confidence levels
- **Solutions** = bets that need validation
- **Discovery** = confidence-building activities
- **Prioritization** = confidence-weighted decisions

Focus on fewer opportunities with higher confidence rather than many opportunities with speculation.

---

## Core Principle

> "The question isn't 'what's most valuable?' but 'what do we have most confidence will be valuable?'"

Discovery doesn't find value. It builds confidence. Prioritization doesn't rank value. It ranks confidence-weighted bets.

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Value is unknowable pre-ship** - Until customers use it, it's a bet
2. **Confidence is assessable** - You can evaluate evidence levels
3. **Low confidence = discovery needed** - Not automatic deprioritization
4. **Discovery builds confidence** - That's its actual purpose
5. **Prioritize by confidence-weighted impact** - Not abstract value scores
