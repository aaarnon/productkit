## Overview

"Prioritize based on value" is bad advice because **value is contextual**. Without defining what value means through vision, strategy, problems, stakeholders, and success metrics, prioritization remains nebulous.

Prioritization happens in cascading layers, not as a single activity.

## The Layered Model

```
LAYER              WHAT YOU'RE PRIORITIZING     CRITERIA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Vision/Strategy    Where to compete             Best path forward
       ↓
Outcomes           Which problems to solve      Enables/blocks strategy
       ↓
Opportunities      Which user needs matter      Strategic alignment
       ↓
Solutions          Which approach to take       Solves prioritized opportunity
```

Each layer's prioritization depends on the layer above it.

## Why "Value" Fails

The advice to "prioritize based on value" assumes:
- Everyone agrees what "value" means
- Value can be compared across different types of work
- A spreadsheet score captures what matters

**Reality:**
- Value to whom? Business? Users? Which users?
- Strategic value vs. tactical value vs. customer value
- Without context, teams debate scores instead of strategy

---

## Prioritization at Each Layer

### Strategy Level

**Question:** Where should we compete?

**Criteria:**
- Market attractiveness
- Competitive advantage potential
- Fit with vision and capabilities

**Not:** Feature comparison or effort estimation

---

### Outcome Level

**Question:** Which problems enable or block our strategy?

**Criteria:**
- Strategic enablement (does solving this unlock strategy?)
- Blocking factor (does NOT solving this prevent strategy?)
- Metric impact

**Not:** User reach or feature requests

---

### Opportunity Level

**Question:** Which user needs should we address?

**Criteria:**
- Strategic alignment (gets you closer to goals)
- Problem significance (how painful for users)
- Market factors (competitive differentiation)

**Critical insight:** "Valuable opportunities are the ones that get you closer to your goals and strategy, not the ones with the highest reach."

High-reach complaints are not automatically high-priority opportunities.

---

### Solution Level

**Question:** Which approach best solves the prioritized opportunity?

**Criteria:**
- Fit with opportunity (does it actually solve it?)
- Effort and complexity
- Confidence in outcome
- Risk profile

**This is where frameworks like DHM, VEUC, and RICE belong.** But only after you've prioritized at the layers above.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Applying RICE to everything | It feels objective | Use RICE only at solution level |
| Prioritizing by reach | Big numbers feel important | Check strategic alignment first |
| Debating priority without strategy | No shared criteria | Define strategy before prioritizing |
| Treating all prioritization the same | Frameworks feel universal | Match approach to layer |

---

## The Foundation Requirement

Without completing foundational work, teams lack criteria for evaluation:

```
No Vision     → Can't prioritize strategy
No Strategy   → Can't prioritize outcomes
No Outcomes   → Can't prioritize opportunities
No Opportunities → Can't prioritize solutions (only features)
```

If prioritization feels impossible, the problem is likely one layer up.

---

## Core Principle

> "Prioritization is only as good as the foundation it sits on. If priority isn't obvious, you probably have a strategy problem, not a prioritization problem."

---

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Value is contextual** - Define it through vision, strategy, and metrics first
2. **Prioritization is layered** - Different criteria at each layer
3. **Don't apply solution frameworks to strategy problems** - RICE doesn't help with "where to compete"
4. **High reach is not high priority** - Strategic alignment matters more
5. **If it's hard to decide, check the layer above** - Missing foundation causes prioritization paralysis
