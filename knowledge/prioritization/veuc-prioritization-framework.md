## Overview

VEUC is a prioritization framework that expands on traditional approaches by explicitly incorporating urgency as a core dimension. The framework consists of four key attributes:

- **V**alue
- **E**ffort
- **U**rgency
- **C**onfidence

---

## The Four Dimensions

### Value (or Impact)
The benefit or positive outcome the work will deliver.
- Business value generated
- Customer value created
- Strategic importance

### Effort
The resources, time, and complexity required.
- Lower effort + high value = optimal targets
- Consider team capacity
- Account for dependencies

### Urgency
The time-sensitivity of the work.
- How quickly does this need attention?
- What happens if it's delayed?
- **Dynamic** - changes over time based on circumstances

**Why Urgency Matters:** Most traditional frameworks (like RICE) implicitly address urgency, while others (like MoSCoW) make it ambiguous. Yet urgency often becomes the deciding factor in real prioritization decisions.

### Confidence
The certainty level regarding estimates and assumptions.
- How sure are we about Value estimate?
- How sure are we about Effort estimate?
- Estimates and ranges suffice for comparison

## Why Urgency is Different

**Urgency changes over time.** Consider:

| Business Type | Peak Urgency Period |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Travel companies | Holiday seasons |
| E-commerce | Black Friday, Christmas |
| Financial services | Tax season |
| Education | Back-to-school |

Work that appears highly urgent during peak periods may become deferrable afterward. **Regular reassessment is essential.**

## How to Assess Each Dimension

| Dimension | Assessment Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Value** | Estimate impact on key metrics or strategic goals |
| **Effort** | T-shirt sizing (S, M, L, XL) or story points |
| **Urgency** | Time-based: immediate, this quarter, this year, later |
| **Confidence** | High, Medium, Low based on evidence available |

**Key insight:** Estimates and ranges over hard data. Intuition is typically sufficient for comparison purposes.

## VEUC vs Other Frameworks

| Framework | Value | Effort | Urgency | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|------------|
| **RICE** | Reach × Impact | Effort | Implicit | Confidence |
| **ICE** | Impact | Confidence | - | Ease |
| **MoSCoW** | Implicit | - | Ambiguous | - |
| **VEUC** | Value | Effort | **Explicit** | Confidence |

## When to Use VEUC

Good fit for:
- Organizations balancing strategic initiatives with firefighting
- Teams requiring stakeholder input in prioritization
- Any work context (large strategic bets to small fixes)
- Situations where shared understanding matters

---

## Scoring Approach

Simple relative scoring:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Low |
| 2 | Medium |
| 3 | High |

**Priority Score = (Value × Urgency × Confidence) / Effort**

Or use qualitative comparison - the framework's strength is triggering the right conversations, not perfect math.

## Core Philosophy

> "The framework's strength lies not in perfect prediction but in triggering the right conversations that yield better decisions and stronger team alignment."

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Urgency is explicit** - Don't leave time-sensitivity implicit
2. **Urgency changes** - Reassess regularly
3. **Estimates are sufficient** - Don't over-engineer scoring
4. **Conversation is the goal** - Framework triggers alignment discussions
5. **Context matters** - Adapt dimensions to your situation
