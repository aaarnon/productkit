## Core Insight

Teams default to what they CAN do (feasible) instead of what they SHOULD do (valuable). The gap between capability and strategic importance reveals organizational dysfunction.

> "Many teams are so focused on what they CAN do, that they forget what they SHOULD do."

## The 9-Box Matrix

|  | **Hard to Do** | **Moderate Effort** | **Easy to Do** |
|--|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **High Value (Should Do)** | Box 1: Blocked | Box 2: Heroics | Box 3: Ideal |
| **Medium Value** | Box 4: Questionable | Box 5: Low-hanging fruit | Box 6: Quick wins |
| **Low Value (Shouldn't Do)** | Box 7: Locally important | Box 8: Busywork | Box 9: Waste |

---

## Box Descriptions

| Box | What It Is | What Happens |
|-----|------------|--------------|
| **Box 1** | Valuable but currently impossible | Blocked by dependencies, org structure, external factors |
| **Box 2** | Valuable but requires unsustainable effort | Teams burn out doing heroic work |
| **Box 3** | Valuable and sustainable | The ideal — but hard to maintain |
| **Box 4** | Challenging with medium value | Often pursued for technical interest, not impact |
| **Box 5** | Moderate value, moderate effort | "Low-hanging fruit" — can unblock Box 1 |
| **Box 6** | Medium value, easy | Quick wins — helpful but not strategic |
| **Box 7** | Hard and low value | Feels locally important but isn't |
| **Box 8** | Easy busywork | Motion without progress — done when blocked |
| **Box 9** | Easy and worthless | Pure waste |

## Why Teams Get Stuck

### "Can Do" Is More Than Technical

What makes something "hard to do" includes:

| Factor | How It Blocks |
|--------|---------------|
| **Organizational structure** | Cross-team dependencies require coordination |
| **Dependency webs** | Waiting on other teams/systems |
| **Psychological safety** | Fear of challenging status quo |
| **Political capital** | Lacking influence to push through |
| **Technical debt** | System constraints make changes hard |

A technically simple task can be organizationally impossible.

## The Default Pattern

```
High-value work is often hard (Box 1, 2)
         ↓
Teams get blocked or burned out
         ↓
Teams shift to what's achievable (Box 5, 6, 8)
         ↓
Organization makes progress on easy stuff
         ↓
Strategic priorities remain stuck
```

---

## Breaking the Pattern

### Option 1: Unblock Box 1

The most valuable action is often removing obstacles to high-value work:
- Clear dependencies
- Get executive sponsorship
- Remove organizational blockers
- Address technical debt blocking strategic work

### Option 2: Use Box 5 Strategically

Low-hanging fruit can create momentum toward Box 1:
- Small wins that unblock bigger work
- Build credibility to tackle harder problems
- Create space/time for strategic work

### Option 3: Stop Box 7, 8, 9

Explicitly identify and stop low-value work:
- Audit what teams are actually doing
- Compare against strategic priorities
- Give permission to say no

## Warning Signs

| Sign | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| Team constantly "busy" but metrics don't move | Stuck in Box 5-9 |
| High turnover, burnout | Stuck in Box 2 |
| Strategic initiatives always delayed | Box 1 blockers not addressed |
| Lots of shipped features, little impact | Optimizing for "can" not "should" |
| Teams avoid certain work areas | Hidden Box 1 blockers |

---

## Using This Framework

### For Teams

1. Map current work to the 9 boxes
2. Calculate % of effort in each box
3. Identify Box 1 blockers
4. Make explicit tradeoffs

### For Leaders

1. Ask: "What should we be doing that we can't?"
2. Invest in unblocking, not just executing
3. Measure strategic progress, not just velocity
4. Create safety to challenge "that's hard"

## Connection to Other Frameworks

| Framework | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| **Priority should be obvious** | If teams default to Box 5-8, strategy isn't clear enough |
| **DHM** | High Delight + Hard-to-copy often lives in Box 1-2 |
| **Four Types of Work** | PMF Expansion work is often Box 1 |
| **OKRs** | Should reflect Box 1-3, not Box 5-8 |

---

## Implications for This System

**For Prioritization skill:**
- Use this matrix when teams feel busy but aren't making strategic progress
- Helps diagnose execution vs strategy problems

**For Strategy agent:**
- Box 1 blockers reveal where strategy meets reality
- If everything important is in Box 1, strategy may be disconnected from capability

**For Alignment agent:**
- Cross-functional blockers often create Box 1 situations
- Alignment work is often "unblocking" work

## Key Quotes

> "Many teams are so focused on what they CAN do, that they forget what they SHOULD do."

> "The breakthrough strategy involves unblocking Box 1 obstacles — sometimes the most valuable action teams can take is removing barriers to essential work."

---

## Quick Reference

```
When prioritizing, ask:

1. SHOULD we do this? (Value)
   - Does it move strategic metrics?
   - Is it in service of our goals?

2. CAN we do this? (Feasibility)
   - Technical difficulty?
   - Organizational blockers?
   - Dependencies?

3. WHERE does it land?
   - Box 1-3: Strategic work
   - Box 4-6: Tactical work
   - Box 7-9: Question or stop

4. WHAT'S blocking Box 1?
   - This is often the real work
