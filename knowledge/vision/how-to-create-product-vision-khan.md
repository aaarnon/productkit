## Overview

A Product Vision is a statement of purpose, a narrative telling the reader WHY your product exists and HOW it will benefit your customers, the market, and the world. A Product Vision helps create focus and alignment, provides context and flexibility, and helps avoid distraction for the team and company.

Creating a vision is an iterative and collaborative exercise that should include a broad range of participants both inside and outside your company. Visions are living documents that are referenced regularly and used to maintain direction and alignment as teams, objectives, and market conditions change.

## What is a Product Vision?

A Product Vision is a description (or a narrative) of the positive, long-term (possibly timeless) aspirational goals or impact you want your product to provide to customers and/or the market.

Breaking this down:
- **Aspirational:** Something ambitious you want to achieve, possibly even inspirational
- **Goals or Impact:** An outcome or advantage your product or company provides
- **Customers/Market:** The vision is focused on them, not your company or your product

It's about the impact provided TO your customers/market and not specifically ABOUT what your product does.

## The Vision Stack

Vision sits at the top of a strategic hierarchy. Each layer is constrained by the layers above it.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Business Vision, Objectives, Strategy │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Product Vision                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Product Objectives                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Product Strategy                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Product Roadmap                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Release Plans                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Multi-product companies** need both business and product visions. Each product maintains its own strategic stack, all aligned to business vision.

**Early-stage startups** may have product vision before company vision.

## Why a Vision is Important

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Clear Context and Direction** | Defines the context of problems the product will address and a stated direction. Provides clarity on WHY the product exists. |
| **Team and Company Alignment** | Aligns teams on the WHY and HOW the product supports company vision. Helps recruiting by defining clear purpose. |
| **Avoid Distraction** | Helps stay focused and not get sidetracked by "shiny objects." Makes it easy to evaluate if new initiatives support the vision. |
| **Flexibility** | Defines purpose, meaning there may be different ways to achieve it. Gives teams flexibility in HOW to fulfill that purpose. |

---

## Vision vs. Mission

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Mission** | Your aspiration of what you will DO (The WHAT) | "To seek out new life, new civilizations. To boldly go where no one has gone before." |
| **Vision** | Your aspiration of the goals you want to achieve or the impact you want to make (The WHY) | Peaceful exploration and cooperation vs. conquest and domination |

The same mission can serve very different visions.

---

## Vision vs. Vision Statement

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vision** | A full narrative explaining the future state |
| **Vision Statement** | A pithy summary distilled from the vision |

**Examples of Vision Statements:**
- **Netflix:** "We want to entertain the world."
- **IKEA:** "To create a better everyday life for the many people."
- **Nike:** "Bring inspiration to every athlete in the world and to make sport a daily habit."

**Important:** Create the full vision narrative first, then distill into a pithy statement.

## Who Should Create the Product Vision?

| Company Stage | Who Leads | Who Participates |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Small Startup** | Founder(s) | Other executives |
| **Scale-up with Product Org** | Product team (PM, Director, VP) | Sales, Marketing, Engineering, other key groups |
| **Large Company** | Product organization | Division-level leaders |

**Critical Requirements:**
- Include diverse perspectives from across the company
- Get input from trusted external parties
- Ensure both input AND buy-in from all stakeholders
- Product organization maintains responsibility for process and outcome

---

## How to Create a Product Vision

1. **Share the process** with internal stakeholders (executives, product, engineering, service, marketing, finance)
2. **Create the first version** with input from internal parties
3. **Socialize internally**, getting feedback and refining as needed
4. **Share with trusted external parties** and gather their input
5. **Look for gaps or assumptions** that need to be addressed
6. **Update and publish** the vision, then evangelize internally

## Components of a Product Vision

### 1. Current (Market) Situation

Ground the vision in the present. Help your audience see what you see in the world today, even if it seems obvious. The vision takes people on a journey from present to future.

**Example:**
> Data management is growing in importance with many new tools being released. But testing of data to ensure it is complete and accurate remains immature and in most cases is performed manually via SQL or spreadsheets.

### 2. Problem That Exists

Problems must be tied to specific people, companies, or entities (the WHO). Include scale and impact.

**Example:**
> Data is the lifeblood of most enterprises, and companies spend billions of dollars every year to process it. But the systems are error-prone. In the US alone, bad data costs companies billions in lost productivity, opportunity, and time.

### 3. Relevant Trends

Identify technology, industry, business, environmental, or societal trends that will impact the market and problem. Given the vision is long-term (5+ years), trends should be significant and lasting.

**Types of trends:**
- Societal: fitness/health focus, environmental consciousness, remote work
- Technological: Cloud, AI, Big Data, wearable computing
- Business/Industry: Industry 4.0, Cybersecurity

### 4. The Opportunity at Hand

Consolidate thinking from the previous three sections. Paint a picture of a better future state. Focus on impact and outcomes, not specific solutions. Define the WHY, not the HOW.

**Example:**
> There are many companies providing tools to help develop data applications, but few products to help test those applications. We see a market gap and an opportunity to create automation tools specifically designed for QA Teams to perform large-scale, flexible data testing WITHOUT requiring SQL knowledge.

### 5. Challenges to Overcome (Optional)

Acknowledge significant obstacles that must be addressed to achieve the vision.

### 6. Stepping Stones to Your Vision (Optional)

Outline major milestones or phases on the path to achieving the full vision.

## Using the Vision

The vision should be:
- **Referenced regularly** in planning and prioritization discussions
- **Used to evaluate** new ideas and opportunities (does this support our vision?)
- **Shared with new hires** as part of onboarding
- **Revisited** when making major strategic decisions

---

## Updating the Vision

Visions are living documents but should not change frequently:

| Trigger for Update | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| Market conditions shift significantly | Review and potentially revise |
| New technology creates new possibilities | Assess if vision needs expansion |
| Original vision achieved | Create next-horizon vision |
| Vision proves unattainable | Revise with learnings |

**Cadence:** Review annually, update only when genuinely needed.
