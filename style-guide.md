# Style Guide

**Applies to:** Documentation outputs (one-pagers, roadmaps, OKRs, strategy docs)
**Does NOT apply to:** Conversational interactions (adapt to user's tone instead)

---

## Core Principles

1. **Keep it succinct** — No fluff. Make every word count.
2. **Minimum viable information** — What's needed to accomplish the purpose, no more.
3. **No concluding errata** — Skip "future considerations," "next steps," "benefits," or "implementation summary" sections. Flag open questions at the top, not in a conclusion.

## Writing Rules (Priority Order)

### 1. Omit Needless Words

Vigorous writing is concise. Make every word tell.

| Verbose | Concise |
|---------|---------|
| "the question as to whether" | "whether" |
| "owing to the fact that" | "because" |
| "in a hasty manner" | "hastily" |
| "there is no doubt but that" | "doubtless" |
| "he is a man who" | "he" |
| "at this point in time" | "now" |

**Before:** "There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground"
**After:** "Dead leaves covered the ground"

### 2. Use Specific, Concrete Language

Prefer specific over general, definite over vague, concrete over abstract.

| Abstract | Concrete |
|----------|----------|
| "A period of unfavorable weather set in" | "It rained every day for a week" |
| "The metric showed improvement" | "Activation rate increased from 20% to 35%" |
| "Users experienced friction" | "40% of users abandoned checkout at the payment step" |

### 3. Use Active Voice

Active voice is more direct and vigorous.

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "The feature was shipped by the team" | "The team shipped the feature" |
| "The decision was made to prioritize X" | "We prioritized X" |
| "It was determined that..." | "We determined..." |

Use passive only when the actor is unknown or unimportant.

### 4. Put Statements in Positive Form

Make definite assertions. Avoid hesitating language.

| Negative/Weak | Positive/Strong |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "He was not very often on time" | "He usually came late" |
| "did not remember" | "forgot" |
| "did not pay attention to" | "ignored" |
| "not unlikely" | "likely" |

### 5. Place Emphasis at the End

The most important information goes at the end of the sentence.

**Weak:** "Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways"

**Strong:** "Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude"

## Document Structure

### Paragraphs

- **One paragraph per topic** — New paragraph signals new topic
- **Topic sentence first** — Reader knows the purpose immediately
- **End with consequence** — Not with digression or minor detail

### Sentences

- **Keep related words together** — Subject and verb shouldn't be separated by transferable clauses
- **Modifiers next to what they modify** — Avoid ambiguity
- **Vary structure** — Don't chain loose sentences with "and," "but," "so"
- **One tense** — Pick present or past and stick with it

### Parallel Construction

Express similar ideas in similar form.

**Inconsistent:** "Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed"

**Parallel:** "Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by the laboratory method"

## Words to Avoid or Use Carefully

| Word | Issue | Alternative |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Very** | Weak intensifier | Use stronger words |
| **However** | Don't start sentences with it | Place mid-sentence |
| **While** | Often misused for "and" or "but" | Use "and," "but," "although" |
| **Less/Fewer** | "Less" for quantity, "fewer" for number | "Fewer users" not "less users" |
| **Like/As** | "Like" for nouns, "as" for clauses | "Do as I say" not "do like I say" |

---

## PM Documentation Specifically

When writing PM artifacts:

1. **Lead with the problem** — Not the solution
2. **Quantify where possible** — "20% churn" not "high churn"
3. **State assumptions explicitly** — Don't hide them
4. **One recommendation** — If you have multiple, prioritize
5. **Cut the preamble** — Skip "This document outlines..." Just start.
