# Company Profile

> This file captures foundational context about your company. It helps the AI give relevant, tailored advice instead of generic frameworks.

**Why this matters:** Company stage directly affects what PM work is appropriate. Pre-PMF companies need different approaches than Series B companies. See `knowledge/alignment/product-team-stages-first-round.md` for the framework.

**Stage → PM Work Mapping:**
- **Pre-PMF (Pre-seed/Seed searching):** Focus on discovery, rapid experimentation. Skip complex roadmaps/OKRs.
- **Early PMF (Seed/Series A):** Balance feature delivery with process introduction. Roadmap planning matters.
- **Growth (Series B+):** Strategic PM work. Multi-quarter planning. Portfolio of bets.
- **Scale (Series C+/Public):** Executive-level portfolio strategy. Organizational complexity.
